		<grouptitle>&lt;b&gt;Galactic Clusters and Superclusters&lt;/b&gt;</grouptitle>
		<groupreading>
		<thereading>Galaxies are not &lt;readinghighlight&gt;evenly&lt;/readinghighlight&gt; distributed throughout the universe. A few float alone like isolated islands in space, but most are grouped in formations termed galactic clusters. These formations should not be confused with stellar clusters, which are globular clusters of stars that exist within a galaxy. The size of galactic clusters varies enormously, with some clusters containing only a dozen or so members, and others containing as many as 10,000. Clusters containing less than 50 galaxies are called "poor" clusters, while those with more than 50 galaxies are considered "rich." Galactic clusters themselves are part of larger clusters of clusters, termed superclusters. It is surmised that even clusters of superclusters are possible.

Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, and our closest galactic neighbors are part of a cluster called the Local Group. The existence of the Local Group was first discovered by the astronomer Edwin Hubble. He coined the term "Local Group" in his 1936 book &lt;i&gt;The Realm of the Nebulae&lt;/i&gt;. The Local Group has around 30 members and is typical in terms of the types of galaxies it contains. There are three large spiral galaxies: Andromeda, the largest galaxy in the group; the Milky Way, the second largest galaxy; and the Triangulum Spiral, the third largest. There are also four medium-sized irregular galaxies, including the Large Cloud of Magellan and the Small Cloud of Magellan, which are companions of our own galaxy. There are four regular elliptical galaxies, including two that are companions of the galaxy Andromeda. The remainder are dwarf ellipticals. Other than our own galaxy, only Andromeda and the Clouds of Magellan can be seen with the naked eye, and the Clouds are visible only from the Southern Hemisphere.

At one time, another large galaxy, Maffei I, was believed to be part of the Local Group. It was discovered in the late 1960s by Italian astronomer Paolo Maffei, who used a radio telescope to "see" through this interstellar mist.  More recent studies, however, indicate that it is actually part of a neighboring galactic cluster. 

In the vicinity of the Local Group are several small clusters, each containing around 12 members. The nearest cluster that is rich in members is the Virgo Cluster, which contains  thousands of  galaxies of all types. The Local Supercluster, which includes the Local Group and the small neighboring clusters, is dominated by the Virgo Cluster. Other notable rich clusters include the Coma Cluster, the Hercules Cluster, and the Perseus Cluster. &lt;readinghighlight&gt;These clusters contain vast amounts of hot gases that emit x-rays, a phenomenon characteristic of rich clusters, and in all of them, the majority of galaxies are concentrated in their centers, another common feature of clusters with many members.&lt;/readinghighlight&gt;

The existence of galactic clusters presented a &lt;readinghighlight&gt;riddle&lt;/readinghighlight&gt; to scientists for many years--the "missing mass" problem. It was presumed that clusters were held together by the gravity generated by their members. However, measurements showed that the galaxies do not have nearly enough mass to explain their apparent stability. Why don't these clusters disintegrate? One theory is that there is some kind of attractive force in addition to gravity that holds clusters together. However, today, most scientists believe in the "dark matter" theory first suggested by Swiss astrophysicist Fritz Zwicky. According to this theory, galactic clusters contain great amounts of "dark matter" that cannot be directly observed but that generates gravitational pull. In a typical cluster perhaps only 15% of the total mass is visible. About 5% is in the form of galaxies and 10% is in the form of hot x-ray-emitting gases, while the remainder is dark matter. The composition of dark matter is unknown, but it might include cold gases, dust, burnt-out stars, perhaps black holes, and maybe even more mysterious components.</thereading>

		<grouptitle>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Biological Control of Weeds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</grouptitle>
		<groupreading>
		<thereading>Humans have struggled against weeds-- plants that thrive where they are unwanted--since the beginnings of agriculture. Weeds &lt;readinghighlight&gt;mar&lt;/readinghighlight&gt; our lawns and gardens, but that is one of their mildest effects. Their pollen triggers allergies in many people. They destroy wildlife habitat and eliminate grazing areas for livestock. They &lt;readinghighlight&gt;hamper&lt;/readinghighlight&gt; farming by competing for sunlight, nutrients, and water with useful plants and by making harvesting difficult. A significant portion of all agricultural labor is dedicated to weed control, and weeding is often one of the most backbreaking agricultural tasks. Despite farmers' efforts, crop losses due to weeds still result in significant financial losses for farmers. &lt;readinghighlight&gt;A 2002 report stated that worldwide, a 13% loss of agricultural production can be blamed on the competitive effects of weeds, which is greater than the combined loss of crops due to insects and plant diseases.&lt;/readinghighlight&gt;

Until about sixty years ago, the only way to control weeds was by physical means. Weeds could be removed by hand or with machines. However, unless the weeds' root systems were carefully dug up, they would simply grow back. In the 1950s, chemical &lt;readinggloss&gt;herbicides&lt;/readinggloss&gt; were developed. These are effective and sometimes necessary, but they pose risks, particularly if misused. Toxic chemicals accumulate in food plants, ground water, and drinking water and directly harm the workers who administer &lt;readinghighlight&gt;them&lt;/readinghighlight&gt; and anyone in the general area.

In recent years, the chemical industry has introduced herbicides that are more ecologically sound than those of the past. Yet new chemicals alone cannot solve the world's weed problems. Thus, scientists are exploring biological methods that harness the innate killing powers of living organisms. Bio-control measures mostly involve plant-eating insects (many scientists working in this field are &lt;readinggloss&gt;&lt;readinghighlight&gt;entomologists&lt;/readinghighlight&gt;&lt;/readinggloss&gt;). Increasingly, however, fungi and microscopic &lt;readinggloss&gt;plant pathogens&lt;/readinggloss&gt; are also being used to destroy weeds. Biological agents generally attack one part of the target weed: roots, stem, leaves, or flowers.

Bio-control agents are far less damaging to the environment than chemicals. Moreover, increasing numbers of weed species are becoming tolerant to herbicides through natural selection. More than 100 cases of herbicide resistance have been reported.  It is impossible, however, for plants to develop resistance to their natural biological enemies. Another advantage of bio-control agents is that they usually must be administered only once, after which no added &lt;readinghighlight&gt;applications&lt;/readinghighlight&gt; are needed. Chemicals typically must be used several times per growing season.

There are situations in which bio-control is not suitable. If a weed is useful in some situations, it is not a good candidate for bio-control. For example, blue weed (viperine) is a harmful pasture weed, but it is a desirable honey plant. Unlike chemical or mechanical treatment, bio-control agents cannot be limited in the area they affect, so "weeds" valued for other purposes are not good targets for bio-control. Additionally, weeds that are closely related to economic crops are not proper candidates for bio-control. The more closely plants are related, the less likely it is that a biological agent can distinguish between the weed and the crop. For example, no bio-control agents have been found that attack wild oats (a type of weed) but not cultivated oats. A third situation in which bio-control agents are not useful is when complete eradication of the weed is required, as in the case of poisonous weeds, because bio-control does not completely eliminate noxious weeds.

Perhaps the two most frequently cited "success stories" involving biological weed control are the control of the prickly pear cactus in Australia by an imported moth and of St. John's wort on &lt;readinggloss&gt;rangeland&lt;/readinggloss&gt; in the U.S. states of Washington and Oregon and the Canadian province of British Columbia. These examples demonstrate that biological control can provide a permanent solution to serious weed problems. After 50 years, the Australian prickly pear is still under control. St. John's wort is presently limited to 2% of its former density in the &lt;readinghighlight&gt;affected areas&lt;/readinghighlight&gt;.

Biological methods of weed control may never replace chemical methods completely, but they should sharply limit the use of dangerous chemicals and reduce the associated risks. They may also make it possible to conquer weeds that defy management by conventional means.</thereading>

Weeds &lt;readinghighlight&gt;mar&lt;/readinghighlight&gt; our lawns and gardens, but that is one of their mildest effects. Their pollen triggers allergies in many people. They destroy wildlife habitat and eliminate grazing areas for livestock. They &lt;readinghighlight&gt;hamper&lt;/readinghighlight&gt; farming by competing for sunlight, nutrients, and water with useful plants and by making harvesting difficult. A significant portion of all agricultural labor is dedicated to weed control, and weeding is often one of the most backbreaking agricultural tasks. Despite farmers' efforts, crop losses due to weeds still result in significant financial losses for farmers. &lt;readinghighlight&gt;A 2002 report stated that worldwide, a 13% loss of agricultural production can be blamed on the competitive effects of weeds, which is greater than the combined loss of crops due to insects and plant diseases.&lt;/readinghighlight&gt;

Until about sixty years ago, the only way to control weeds was by physical means. Weeds could be removed by hand or with machines. However, unless the weeds' root systems were carefully dug up, they would simply grow back. In the 1950s, chemical &lt;readinggloss&gt;herbicides&lt;/readinggloss&gt; were developed. These are effective and sometimes necessary, but they pose risks, particularly if misused. Toxic chemicals accumulate in food plants, ground water, and drinking water and directly harm the workers who administer &lt;readinghighlight&gt;them&lt;/readinghighlight&gt; and anyone in the general area.

In recent years, the chemical industry has introduced herbicides that are more ecologically sound than those of the past. Yet new chemicals alone cannot solve the world's weed problems. Thus, scientists are exploring biological methods that harness the innate killing powers of living organisms. Bio-control measures mostly involve plant-eating insects (many scientists working in this field are &lt;readinggloss&gt;&lt;readinghighlight&gt;entomologists&lt;/readinghighlight&gt;&lt;/readinggloss&gt;). Increasingly, however, fungi and microscopic &lt;readinggloss&gt;plant pathogens&lt;/readinggloss&gt; are also being used to destroy weeds. Biological agents generally attack one part of the target weed: roots, stem, leaves, or flowers.

Bio-control agents are far less damaging to the environment than chemicals. Moreover, increasing numbers of weed species are becoming tolerant to herbicides through natural selection. More than 100 cases of herbicide resistance have been reported.  It is impossible, however, for plants to develop resistance to their natural biological enemies. Another advantage of bio-control agents is that they usually must be administered only once, after which no added &lt;readinghighlight&gt;applications&lt;/readinghighlight&gt; are needed. Chemicals typically must be used several times per growing season.

There are situations in which bio-control is not suitable. If a weed is useful in some situations, it is not a good candidate for bio-control. For example, blue weed (viperine) is a harmful pasture weed, but it is a desirable honey plant. Unlike chemical or mechanical treatment, bio-control agents cannot be limited in the area they affect, so "weeds" valued for other purposes are not good targets for bio-control. Additionally, weeds that are closely related to economic crops are not proper candidates for bio-control. The more closely plants are related, the less likely it is that a biological agent can distinguish between the weed and the crop. For example, no bio-control agents have been found that attack wild oats (a type of weed) but not cultivated oats. A third situation in which bio-control agents are not useful is when complete eradication of the weed is required, as in the case of poisonous weeds, because bio-control does not completely eliminate noxious weeds.

Perhaps the two most frequently cited "success stories" involving biological weed control are the control of the prickly pear cactus in Australia by an imported moth and of St. John's wort on &lt;readinggloss&gt;rangeland&lt;/readinggloss&gt; in the U.S. states of Washington and Oregon and the Canadian province of British Columbia. These examples demonstrate that biological control can provide a permanent solution to serious weed problems. After 50 years, the Australian prickly pear is still under control. St. John's wort is presently limited to 2% of its former density in the &lt;readinghighlight&gt;affected areas&lt;/readinghighlight&gt;.

Biological methods of weed control may never replace chemical methods completely, but they should sharply limit the use of dangerous chemicals and reduce the associated risks. They may also make it possible to conquer weeds that defy management by conventional means.</thereading>

		<grouptitle>&lt;b&gt;Lucy Maud Montgomery, Author of the &lt;i&gt;Anne&lt;/i&gt; Books&lt;/b&gt;</grouptitle>
		<groupreading>
		<thereading>To date, Canada has produced only one author of children's books that rank with the stories of Lewis Carroll (&lt;i&gt;Alice's Adventures in Wonderland&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Through the Looking Glass&lt;/i&gt;) and those of Mark Twain (&lt;i&gt;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&lt;/i&gt;). This is Lucy Maud Montgomery, writer of &lt;i&gt;Anne of Green Gables&lt;/i&gt; and other &lt;i&gt;Anne&lt;/i&gt; books. 

Lucy Maud Montgomery was born in Clifton (now New London), &lt;readinggloss&gt;Prince Edward Island&lt;/readinggloss&gt; in 1874. When she was only 21 months old, her mother died of &lt;readinggloss&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/readinggloss&gt;. Her father moved to Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, in western Canada, where he eventually remarried. Montgomery was raised by her mother's parents, who ran the post office in the small town of Cavendish, Prince Edward Island. She attended a one-room school house in Cavendish. Except for one year spent with her father in Prince Albert, all of her early education took place &lt;readinghighlight&gt;there&lt;/readinghighlight&gt;. Lucy received a teaching certificate from Prince of Wales College and then studied English literature at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia at a time when few women attended college. After leaving the university in 1895, Montgomery worked as a teacher and a journalist in Halifax. In 1898, Montgomery's grandfather died, and she returned to Cavendish to take care of her grandmother and to help her run the post office. Montgomery remained in Cavendish for the next thirteen years. After the death of her grandmother in 1911, Montgomery married Ewan Macdonald, a clergyman to whom she had been secretly engaged for two years, and they moved that year to Leaksdale, Ontario.

As a child living with an elderly couple, Montgomery found companionship in her imagination, books, nature, and writing. She began writing a journal when she was only eight and then began writing poems and fantastic stories about fairies and princesses. She sold her first story during the year she spent with her father in Saskatchewan and continued writing poems and stories for children's magazines in Canada, Britain, and the United States while she was studying in college and while she was teaching. By the time she returned to Cavendish to care for her grandmother, she was earning a comfortable income from her writing. In 1905, she wrote her first and most famous novel, &lt;i&gt;Anne of Green Gables&lt;/i&gt;. The first publisher she sent it to rejected it and Lucy put the manuscript away in a hat box. In 1907, she &lt;readinghighlight&gt;came across&lt;/readinghighlight&gt; the manuscript and decided to send it to Page Publishing Company in Boston. It was accepted and published the following year. It immediately became a best-seller. At first Montgomery resisted her publisher's pressure to write a sequel, but she wrote two before she left Cavendish and three more about Anne's later life after moving to Ontario.
 
Montgomery incorporated many events from her life into the &lt;i&gt;Anne&lt;/i&gt; books, and much of the town of Cavendish is reflected in the fictional Prince Edward Island town of Avonlea. Both Montgomery and her &lt;readinghighlight&gt;protagonist&lt;/readinghighlight&gt; Anne Shirley are adventurous, imaginative, and determined, although Anne is more hot-tempered and talkative than Montgomery was. At the beginning of &lt;i&gt;Anne of Green Gables&lt;/i&gt;, Anne's parents have died, and she is in an orphanage. She is sent to live with Matthew Cuthbert and his sister Marilla, who actually hoped to adopt a boy to help them with farm work. Much of the book deals with Anne's search for independence in a world dominated by kindly but sometimes smothering adults. 

After her marriage, Montgomery returned to Prince Edward Island only for vacations. However, she continued to write about the province. All but one of her twenty novels are set there.
&lt;readinghighlight&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Anne&lt;/i&gt; books still have a following all over the world: in Canada, the United States, Europe, Australia, China, and especially Japan, where Anne is something of an icon.&lt;/readinghighlight&gt; Her novels have helped create a warm, pleasant image of Prince Edward Island and have contributed significantly to tourism there. "Anne fans" from all over the world &lt;readinghighlight&gt;scour&lt;/readinghighlight&gt; the island for scenes described in the books. Several movies, a  television series, and a musical play have been based on Montgomery's books, and the Green Gables Farmhouse in Cavendish, where she lived when she wrote the first &lt;i&gt;Anne&lt;/i&gt; books, has been designated a national monument.
