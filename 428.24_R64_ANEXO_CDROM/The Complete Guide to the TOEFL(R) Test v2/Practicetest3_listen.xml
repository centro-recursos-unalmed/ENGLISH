<sectionname>Listening Section Directions</sectionname>
<sectiondirections>This section tests your understanding of conversations and lectures.  You will hear each conversation or lecture only once. Your answers should be based on what is stated or implied in the conversations and lectures.

You are allowed to take notes as you listen, and you can use these notes to help you answer the questions. 

In some questions, you will see a headphones icon.   &lt;icon&gt;   This icon tells you that you will hear, but not read, part of the lecture again. Then you will answer a question about the part of the lecture that you heard.

Some questions have special directions that are &lt;readinghighlight&gt;highlighted&lt;/readinghighlight&gt;.

This test includes two conversations and four lectures.

You must give an answer for every question, and then click &lt;b&gt;NEXT&lt;/b&gt;. To confirm your answer, click &lt;b&gt;OK&lt;/b&gt;. Once the next question appears, you cannot go back to earlier questions.
