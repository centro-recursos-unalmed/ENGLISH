<sectionname>Speaking Section Directions</sectionname>
<sectiondirections>This section tests your ability to speak about various subjects. There are six tasks in this section. Listen carefully to the directions, and read the questions on the screen. The first two tasks are independent speaking tasks. You have 15 seconds in which to prepare your response. When you hear a beep on the Listening Program, you will have 45 seconds in which to answer the question.

The last four tasks are integrated speaking tasks. The third and fourth questions involve a reading text and a listening passage. You will have 45 seconds in which to read a short text. You will then hear a short conversation or part of a lecture on the same topic. You may take notes on both the reading and listening passage. You will then see a question on the screen asking about the information that you have just read and heard, and you will have 30 seconds in which to plan a response. When you hear a beep on the Listening Program, you will have 60 seconds in which to answer the question. 

The fifth and sixth questions involve a short listening passage. You may take notes as you listen. After listening to the conversation or lecture, you will see a question, and you will have 20 seconds in which to plan your response. When you hear a beep on the Listening Program, you will have 60 seconds in which to answer the question.

A clock on the screen will tell you how much preparation time or how much response time (speaking time) remains for each question. It is important that you time yourself accurately when you take this practice test. On an actual test your responses will be recorded and evaluated by trained raters. </sectiondirections>

As of September 9, no one may ride their bicycles on the sidewalks or pedestrian walkways on the central campus. These paths will be reserved entirely for the use of pedestrians. Bicyclists must dismount and walk their bicycles on these pathways. Bicycle riding on campus is restricted to the bicycle paths along College Avenue, Fourth Street, and Hillsdale Avenue. 

After September 9, anyone bicycling in these restricted areas may be ticketed by the campus police department.</thereading>

			<thereading>As early as 1687, the scientist Sir Isaac Newton wrote that it would be possible for an artificial satellite to orbit the Earth. Of course, at that time, the technology needed to build and to launch a satellite did not exist. In 1945, science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke wrote an article in which he described a worldwide system of communication satellites. The first artificial satellite, Sputnik, was launched by the Soviet Union in 1957. Satellites have made many scientific discoveries, such as the discovery of the Van Allen radiation belts. They are used to keep track of weather here on Earth. As Clarke predicted, they permit instantaneous communications between continents. They help ships and airplanes navigate. Basically, satellites have revolutionized science and technology and have changed the way we live in fundamental ways.</thereading>
