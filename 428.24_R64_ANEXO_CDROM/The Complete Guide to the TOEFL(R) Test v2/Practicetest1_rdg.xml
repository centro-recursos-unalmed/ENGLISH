		<grouptitle>&lt;b&gt;Bioluminescence&lt;/b&gt;</grouptitle>
		<groupreading>
		<thereading>Bioluminescence, or "living light," is produced by a number of organisms. It is most common among marine creatures, especially deep-sea fish. In fact, 90% of deep-sea marine life is estimated to produce bioluminescence in one form or another. Among land animals, the most familiar light-emitting organisms are certain adult insects known as fireflies and their &lt;readinggloss&gt;larval&lt;/readinggloss&gt; forms, known as glowworms. Bacteria, protozoa, crustaceans, fungi, and mollusks all have species that emit light. The only groups that do not display bioluminescence are freshwater fish, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and leafy plants.

Bioluminescence is produced when a &lt;readinggloss&gt;pigment&lt;/readinggloss&gt; called luciferin is combined with oxygen in the presence of an &lt;readinggloss&gt;enzyme&lt;/readinggloss&gt; called lucifrase. When other chemicals take part in the reaction, the color of the light changes, ranging from yellow-green to blue, blue-green, green, violet, and red. Bioluminescence is often called "cold light" because almost no energy is lost as heat. It compares favorably in efficiency with fluorescent lighting.

Some organisms, such as fungi, emit a steady glow. Others, such as fireflies, blink on and off. Certain types of bacteria that grow on decomposing plants produce a shimmering luminescence. The popular name for this &lt;readinghighlight&gt;eerie&lt;/readinghighlight&gt; light is "foxfire." Some organisms, such as dinoflagellates, emit light only when disturbed. When a ship plows through tropical waters at night (particularly in the Indian Ocean), millions of these single-cell algae light up, producing the "milky sea" phenomenon, a softly glowing streak in &lt;readinghighlight&gt;the wake of the ship&lt;/readinghighlight&gt;.

In some species, the role of bioluminescence is obvious. Fireflies and marine fireworms use their light to attract mates. The anglerfish uses a dangling luminous organ to attract prey to come within striking distance. &lt;readinghighlight&gt;The cookie cutter shark utilizes a bioluminescent patch on its underbelly to appear as a small fish to lure large predatory fish such as tuna and mackerel, and when these fish try to consume the "small fish," they are attacked by the shark.&lt;/readinghighlight&gt; The bobtail squid uses its bioluminescence as nighttime camouflage. When viewed from below, its spots of light blend in with the light of the stars and the moon. Some squids use luminous fluids to confuse and escape from predators in the same way that other squids use their dark ink. It is widely believed that many of the creatures that live in the dark depths of the ocean developed the ability to produce light simply as a way to see around them.  Most deep-sea creatures produce blue and green light, and unsurprisingly, light of those colors has the most powerful penetrating power in water.  The only cave-dwelling creature capable of generating light is a New Zealand glowworm.

The reasons why fungi, bacteria, and protozoa are able to glow are more &lt;readinghighlight&gt;obscure&lt;/readinghighlight&gt;. Perhaps, at one time, it was a way to use up oxygen. Millions of years ago, before green plants created oxygen, there was little of that gas in the atmosphere, and living creatures could not use it. Indeed, it may have been poisonous to some creatures. As more oxygen was created by green plants, new types of life developed that could breathe it. Some species died off, while other species developed techniques such as bioluminescence to reduce the amount of oxygen in their immediate environment and thus survive in the richer atmosphere. &lt;readinghighlight&gt;These organisms&lt;/readinghighlight&gt; have since adapted and are no longer poisoned by oxygen, so their bioluminescence is no longer functional.

Through genetic engineering, scientists have been able to produce bioluminescence in species that do not naturally have it, such as tobacco plants. This ability was originally developed as a way to trace the movement of substances through a living plant, but other uses have been suggested. Some people have proposed lining highways with glowing trees to save electricity. Others have proposed producing luminous ornamental plants for the lawn or garden, or even pets such as goldfish, mice, and rabbits that glow in the dark. Scientists are also studying bioluminescent organisms in order to learn how to produce light chemically without producing heat. Someday homes may be lit with lamps based on a method of creating light suggested by bioluminescent creatures.</thereading>

		<grouptitle>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Modern Times&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</grouptitle>
		<groupreading>
		<thereading>Probably Charlie Chaplin's most important film is his comic masterpiece &lt;i&gt;Modern Times&lt;/i&gt;, made in 1936.  Set in the Great Depression era, the film's main concerns are those of millions of people at the time: unemployment, poverty, and economic oppression. Chaplin was motivated to make the film by a journalist who, while interviewing him, happened to describe working conditions in industrial Detroit. Chaplin was told that healthy young men were attracted by promises of high wages to come work on the assembly lines in the automobile factories there. The stress of long hours and endlessly repetitive work soon destroyed these young men's physical and mental health.

Chaplin not only starred in &lt;i&gt;Modern Times&lt;/i&gt; but also wrote the script and the music and directed and produced it. It was the last movie in which Chaplin played the "Little Tramp," a popular character he had first created in 1915. The Little Tramp is a simple, kind wanderer with a small mustache, a Derby hat, baggy pants, and a cane. He falls into many misfortunes but always maintains a sweet, sad optimism. &lt;i&gt;Modern Times&lt;/i&gt; was also Chaplin's final silent movie. &lt;readinggloss&gt;"Talkies"&lt;/readinggloss&gt; had appeared nine years earlier, but Chaplin's humor was mostly based on body language and visual &lt;readinghighlight&gt;gags&lt;/readinghighlight&gt;. However, it is somewhat deceptive to call &lt;i&gt;Modern Times&lt;/i&gt; a silent film. While there is no dialogue, there is music and sound effects, such as the roar of machinery and the scream of factory whistles. In &lt;i&gt;Modern Times&lt;/i&gt;, the world of sound is the noisy world of technology, while the Tramp, a symbol of humanity, is silent.

Only about one third of &lt;i&gt;Modern Times&lt;/i&gt; takes place inside a futuristic factory (the Electro Steel Works), but these are the scenes viewers remember most vividly. The Tramp has one job, to tighten nuts and bolts on the machines in the factory with a large wrench. In one inventive scene, he is chosen to test an automatic feeding machine. The machine can be brought to the assembly line so that workers do not have to pause for lunch. The device suddenly malfunctions. It hurls food at the Tramp, who is strapped into his position on the assembly line and cannot escape. &lt;readinghighlight&gt;This&lt;/readinghighlight&gt; illustrates people's utter helplessness in the face of machines that should be serving them. In another memorable scene, the owner orders that the speed of the assembly line be increased to its maximum level. No one who has seen the film can forget watching Chaplin vainly trying to keep pace with the conveyor belt. At one point in this scene, he is taken inside, literally "eaten" by the &lt;readinghighlight&gt;nightmarish&lt;/readinghighlight&gt; machinery, and caught up in its whirring wheels, gears, and cogs. The Tramp loses his mind and rushes around trying to tighten anything that resembles a nut, including the buttons on a woman's dress. He is led from the factory by attendants in white coats and is taken away.

The Tramp recovers from his nervous breakdown and is released. The doctor tells him, "Take it easy and avoid excitement," but for the rest of this episodic film, the Tramp experiences one calamity after another. He unintentionally joins a labor strike and later is sent to jail. He becomes a roller-skating night watchman at a department store, an overstressed singing waiter, and a fugitive from the law. He meets an orphan (played by Chaplin's real-life wife, Paulette Goddard) and becomes her friend and protector. In the final scene, the Tramp walks down a country road into the sunset. This is a &lt;readinghighlight&gt;stock&lt;/readinghighlight&gt; ending for Chaplin films, but usually the tramp walks off alone. In his last film, the Tramp walks off arm-in-arm with the girl.

Clearly, &lt;i&gt;Modern Times&lt;/i&gt; has its flaws, but it is the best film about the effects of technology on humanity ever made. It is as relevant now as it was when it was first made. It does not offer a radical social message, but it warns that standardization, mechanization, and misuse of authority rob men and women of their individuality. It also offers a reminder that, no matter how bad things seem, one can always smile.</thereading>

		<thereading>Probably Charlie Chaplin's most important film is his comic masterpiece &lt;i&gt;Modern Times&lt;/i&gt;, made in 1936.  Set in the Great Depression era, the film's main concerns are those of millions of people at the time: unemployment, poverty, and economic oppression. Chaplin was motivated to make the film by a journalist who, while interviewing him, happened to describe working conditions in industrial Detroit. Chaplin was told that healthy young men were attracted by promises of high wages to come work on the assembly lines in the automobile factories there. The stress of long hours and endlessly repetitive work soon destroyed these young men's physical and mental health.

Chaplin not only starred in &lt;i&gt;Modern Times&lt;/i&gt; but also wrote the script and the music and directed and produced it. It was the last movie in which Chaplin played the "Little Tramp," a popular character he had first created in 1915. The Little Tramp is a simple, kind wanderer with a small mustache, a Derby hat, baggy pants, and a cane. He falls into many misfortunes but always maintains a sweet, sad optimism. &lt;i&gt;Modern Times&lt;/i&gt; was also Chaplin's final silent movie. &lt;readinggloss&gt;"Talkies"&lt;/readinggloss&gt; had appeared nine years earlier, but Chaplin's humor was mostly based on body language and visual &lt;readinghighlight&gt;gags&lt;/readinghighlight&gt;. However, it is somewhat deceptive to call &lt;i&gt;Modern Times&lt;/i&gt; a silent film. While there is no dialogue, there is music and sound effects, such as the roar of machinery and the scream of factory whistles. In &lt;i&gt;Modern Times&lt;/i&gt;, the world of sound is the noisy world of technology, while the Tramp, a symbol of humanity, is silent.

Only about one third of &lt;i&gt;Modern Times&lt;/i&gt; takes place inside a futuristic factory (the Electro Steel Works), but these are the scenes viewers remember most vividly. The Tramp has one job, to tighten nuts and bolts on the machines in the factory with a large wrench. In one inventive scene, he is chosen to test an automatic feeding machine. The machine can be brought to the assembly line so that workers do not have to pause for lunch. The device suddenly malfunctions. It hurls food at the Tramp, who is strapped into his position on the assembly line and cannot escape. &lt;readinghighlight&gt;This&lt;/readinghighlight&gt; illustrates people's utter helplessness in the face of machines that should be serving them. In another memorable scene, the owner orders that the speed of the assembly line be increased to its maximum level. No one who has seen the film can forget watching Chaplin vainly trying to keep pace with the conveyor belt. At one point in this scene, he is taken inside, literally "eaten" by the &lt;readinghighlight&gt;nightmarish&lt;/readinghighlight&gt; machinery, and caught up in its whirring wheels, gears, and cogs. The Tramp loses his mind and rushes around trying to tighten anything that resembles a nut, including the buttons on a woman's dress. He is led from the factory by attendants in white coats and is taken away.

The Tramp recovers from his nervous breakdown and is released. The doctor tells him, "Take it easy and avoid excitement," but for the rest of this episodic film, the Tramp experiences one calamity after another. He unintentionally joins a labor strike and later is sent to jail. He becomes a roller-skating night watchman at a department store, an overstressed singing waiter, and a fugitive from the law. He meets an orphan (played by Chaplin's real-life wife, Paulette Goddard) and becomes her friend and protector. In the final scene, the Tramp walks down a country road into the sunset. This is a &lt;readinghighlight&gt;stock&lt;/readinghighlight&gt; ending for Chaplin films, but usually the tramp walks off alone. In his last film, the Tramp walks off arm-in-arm with the girl.

Clearly, &lt;i&gt;Modern Times&lt;/i&gt; has its flaws, but it is the best film about the effects of technology on humanity ever made. It is as relevant now as it was when it was first made. It does not offer a radical social message, but it warns that standardization, mechanization, and misuse of authority rob men and women of their individuality. It also offers a reminder that, no matter how bad things seem, one can always smile.</thereading>

		<grouptitle>&lt;b&gt;Balloon-Frame Houses&lt;/b&gt;</grouptitle>
		<groupreading>
		<thereading>Until the 1830s, &lt;readinghighlight&gt;domestic&lt;/readinghighlight&gt; architectural styles in North America were heavily influenced by European styles. The log cabin of the frontier came from Sweden, brought by settlers to the Swedish colony of Delaware in the 1630s. The typical residence in Colonial cities was heavily influenced by the standard British house of the time. No doubt there were some uniquely North American touches, but on the whole, the North American style of building houses was an adaptation of European construction methods.

Two factors made building different in North America. One was an abundance of wood. Wood was used at a rate impossible to match in a mostly deforested Europe. &lt;readinghighlight&gt;The other&lt;/readinghighlight&gt;  was the fact that labor was scarce in most communities. European houses built in the traditional timber-frame style used heavy cut stone. That took a huge toll in labor. Another key feature of European houses was the use of heavy timbers fitted with complex joints. Wooden pegs were used instead of iron nails. This type of home construction was time-consuming and required a team of expert carpenters and other workers with specialized tools. Fundamentally, it was the same method of building homes that had been used in Europe since medieval times.

In 1833, while constructing houses in Fort Dearborn, Illinois, Augustine Taylor, a builder from Hartford, Connecticut, invented a new method of building that utilized a framework of lightweight lumber. This was the birth of the "balloon-frame house." This type of house could be built in under a week by two or three careful workers who could saw in a straight line and hammer a nail. Almost overnight, home construction changed from a specialized craft into an industry.

Skeptics predicted that the first strong wind would send a balloon-frame house flying off its foundations and into the air, and at first, &lt;i&gt;balloon-frame&lt;/i&gt; was a term of &lt;readinghighlight&gt;scorn&lt;/readinghighlight&gt;. In fact, these houses were more like woven baskets than like balloons. They were light, flexible, and yet very sturdy.

Balloon-frame houses required huge amounts of machine-planed lumber. This demand was met by improved &lt;readinggloss&gt;sawmill&lt;/readinggloss&gt; technology that could quickly cut boards to standard sizes. They also required enormous numbers of machine-made nails. These were provided by recently developed automated nail-making machines. &lt;readinghighlight&gt;After 1800, the cost of nails in the United States steadily dropped, and by 1830 one could buy a five-pound bag of nails for pennies, less than the tax alone on a bag of nails in Europe.&lt;/readinghighlight&gt;

The balloon-frame design first caught on in Chicago, Illinois. In the 1830s, that city established itself as a new gateway to the West. And with a &lt;readinghighlight&gt;mushrooming&lt;/readinghighlight&gt; population came a soaring demand for housing. Because they could be built so quickly, most new houses were balloon-frame houses. Another advantage of balloon-frame houses was their mobility. Today, houses are seldom moved, but Chicagoans in the 1830s, 1840s, and 1850s took advantage of the mobility of lightweight balloon-frame structures without utility connections. New arrivals could buy homes and then move them to more desirable locations. Chester Tupper, Chicago's first house mover, moved thousands of homes on rollers through Chicago's unpaved streets. The downside of balloon frame houses was that they were made almost exclusively of flammable materials. Chicago rapidly became a city of wood. That fact came back to haunt the city on a hot, terrible night in 1871.

This building method spread from Chicago to the cities, towns, and farms of the American and Canadian West, where new settlers needed shelter in a hurry. Always ready to supply a new product, Chicago provided settlers with prefabricated kits for building balloon-frame structures. The Lyman-Bridges Company sold buildings of "any size or style, in any number, on short notice." Shipped by rail, the building kits contained milled lumber, roofing shingles, windows, doors, and building plans. The smallest house offered by the company was a one-room house measuring 10 by 12 feet (3.3 by 4.0 meters), while the largest had eight big rooms as well as a pantry, several hallways, and four closets. Prices ranged from $175 for the smallest model to $3,500 for the deluxe model. These reasonable prices allowed many workers the luxury of owning their own homes, in contrast to Europe where traditional construction techniques kept the rates of home ownership low for most of the nineteenth century. Balloon-frame housing remained the dominant style of home building in North America until the 1940s.</thereading>
