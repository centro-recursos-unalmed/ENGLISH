<sectionname>Speaking Section Directions</sectionname>
<sectiondirections>This section tests your ability to speak about various subjects. There are six tasks in this section. Listen carefully to the directions, and read the questions on the screen. The first two tasks are independent speaking tasks. You have 15 seconds in which to prepare your response. When you hear a beep on the Listening Program, you will have 45 seconds in which to answer the question.

The last four tasks are integrated speaking tasks. The third and fourth questions involve a reading text and a listening passage. You will have 45 seconds in which to read a short text. You will then hear a short conversation or part of a lecture on the same topic. You may take notes on both the reading and listening passage. You will then see a question on the screen asking about the information that you have just read and heard, and you will have 30 seconds in which to plan a response. When you hear a beep on the Listening Program, you will have 60 seconds in which to answer the question. 

The fifth and sixth questions involve a short listening passage. You may take notes as you listen. After listening to the conversation or lecture, you will see a question, and you will have 20 seconds in which to plan your response. When you hear a beep on the Listening Program, you will have 60 seconds in which to answer the question.

A clock on the screen will tell you how much preparation time or how much response time (speaking time) remains for each question. It is important that you time yourself accurately when you take this practice test. On an actual test your responses will be recorded and evaluated by trained raters.

The course will focus on locating and evaluating information from print and non-print resources: 
 
*  specialized encyclopedias  
*  magazines and newspapers

*  Internet websites

Students will learn to use the following research tools:

*  online library catalog

Students will learn to evaluate information that they find according to their accuracy, authority, and timeliness. They will also learn to prepare bibliographies.

			<thereading>Situation comedies, or sitcoms, first became popular on radio, and then moved to television in the late 1940s. They involve a cast of characters that reappear in each episode. The characters are usually part of a tight-knit group, most often members of a family, but they may also be friends, coworkers, or neighbors. Most episodes are self-contained; a problem of some kind arises and is resolved by the end of the show. Some sitcoms, however, have ongoing stories, often involving romantic relationships, that develop from episode to episode.

Most sitcom episodes are formulaic. In other words, they follow similar plots, similar story lines. Since the first sitcom, characters have faced the same basic problems. One common formula is that one or more characters try to deceive others, or hide the truth from them, and this leads to many comic situations.

Successful sitcoms generally have predictable life cycles. For the first few years, the writing is creative, and more viewers watch every week. After several years, sitcoms reach their peak in terms of creativity and audience. Something often goes wrong. Perhaps some key actors leave the show. The writers bring in new characters or introduce new premises, but these seldom work. Before long, the sitcom is cancelled.</thereading>
