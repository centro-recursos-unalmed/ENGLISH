<p begin="00:00:05.00" dur="00:00:04.50">New Zealand is a land of many beautiful and quiet natural places.</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.04" dur="00:00:02.00">Queenstown isn't one of them.</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.06" dur="00:00:04.50">“Diving out that way, here we go: five, four, three, two, one, push it out!”</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.60" dur="00:00:04.00">People come from around the world to do adventure sports in Queenstown - </p>
<p begin="00:00:25.25" dur="00:00:02.00">especially bungee jumping.</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.28" dur="00:00:07.20">“The gap there from the underside of that little silver jump pod out there is 134 meters, which is about 440 feet.” </p>
<p begin="00:00:37.23" dur="00:00:03.50">That's a long way down! But the sport must be fun.</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.17" dur="00:00:02.30">There are many people waiting for a chance to do it.</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.28" dur="00:00:02.10">What do they feel like before a jump?</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.40" dur="00:00:02.50">“I’m so ready! Bring it on!”</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.10" dur="00:00:01.50">“I’m getting excited actually, yeah.” </p>
<p begin="00:00:51.92" dur="00:00:02.50">“Five, four, three, two, one..."</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.92" dur="00:00:03.60">If you like exciting adventure sports, New Zealand is the place to do them. </p>
<p begin="00:00:59.10" dur="00:00:06.40">“New Zealand people have a very immediate lifestyle a lot of the time, and that’s what people can experience when they come here.” </p>
<p begin="00:01:10.07" dur="00:00:01.30">“Nothing like it!” </p>
<p begin="00:01:11.82" dur="00:00:02.30">Riding in a jetboat is a special experience.</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.30" dur="00:00:02.60">It's yet another New Zealand adventure invention.</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.96" dur="00:00:03.30">There’s no propeller, so the boats can work in shallow water.</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.30" dur="00:00:02.50">"These machines...you can spin'em on a dime!"</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.20" dur="00:00:04.65">Jetboats were especially designed to get around New Zealand's shallow rivers,</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.92" dur="00:00:03.00">but they're also really good at giving customers a thrill.</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.00" dur="00:00:04.00">“Ha ha ha! Yee hee hee!"</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.08" dur="00:00:03.70">"This is one of the number-one pastimes of people coming to New Zealand...</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.90" dur="00:00:02.00">more importantly probably Queenstown."</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.97" dur="00:00:04.00">In New Zealand, it seems that nearly every day someone creates another adventure sport.</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.07" dur="00:00:02.90">"You know we quite proudly call ourselves 'The Adventure Capital of the World.'"</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.00" dur="00:00:02.65">"There are so many adventure activities to do here."</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.71" dur="00:00:04.35">"In fact, we worked it out that if you did one of every type of activity you’d be here for 60 days!” </p>
<p begin="00:02:05.89" dur="00:00:01.50">"Okay, we're off."</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.60" dur="00:00:03.90">One of the newest adventures involves a five-hour hike up a mountain. </p>
<p begin="00:02:13.90" dur="00:00:04.90">The best part is, at the end of the hike, the hikers don’t have to walk all the way down again. </p>
<p begin="00:02:18.98" dur="00:00:02.90">“We’ll stay here for ten minutes or so...fifteen minutes."</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.98" dur="00:00:03.00">"Then we’ll jump in the helicopter and fly back to Queenstown.” </p>
<p begin="00:02:25.20" dur="00:00:05.00">The helicopter turns the five-hour hike into a five-minute flight back to the city!</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.25" dur="00:00:04.00">These different adventure sports really help the tourism industry in New Zealand.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.85" dur="00:00:03.00">They're also part of an adventurous culture that goes back</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.86" dur="00:00:04.50">to the birthplace of adventure tourism in New Zealand - the Kawarau Bridge.</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.82" dur="00:00:03.00">The bridge was the world's first commercial bungee-jumping site.</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.94" dur="00:00:02.50">"I think it's great - if somebody else is doing it!"</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.81" dur="00:00:04.50">High wire bungee and bridge bungee are both thrilling and slightly frightening sports.</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.91" dur="00:00:04.00">"Here we go Marlene, leaning forward: five, four, three, two, one!"</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.93" dur="00:00:04.50">“The people who have to really try hard to jump are the ones that get the most out of it.” </p>
<p begin="00:03:10.60" dur="00:00:02.00">At least that's what some people think.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.81" dur="00:00:01.00">"How was that?"</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.83" dur="00:00:02.00">"I'm never bungee jumping again!"</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.40" dur="00:00:03.00">Maybe for some people, jumping once is enough.</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.99" dur="00:00:01.00">"Cheers!"</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.88" dur="00:00:02.00">"Ah, we deserve that."</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.98" dur="00:00:01.60">"That was a good one!"</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.89" dur="00:00:02.50">Most jumpers are happy that they did it.</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.40" dur="00:00:03.00">Here in the land of adventure, the only question may be:</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.87" dur="00:00:02.00">what will they think of doing next?</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.10" dur="00:00:03.70">Whatever it is, someone here in The Adventure Capital of the World</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.92" dur="00:00:02.00">will be ready to give it a try!</p>
