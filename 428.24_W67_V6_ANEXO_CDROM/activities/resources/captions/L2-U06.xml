	<p begin="00:00:10.50" dur="00:00:04.00">The Nubian wedding ritual, shared by the entire village...</p>
	<p begin="00:00:14.60" dur="00:00:02.70">for 7 days and 7 nights.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:18.10" dur="00:00:07.50">The air is perfumed by incense and filled with the sound of beating drums, and joyful Nubian songs.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:26.00" dur="00:00:05.00">Two years ago, Sheriff's family told him it was time to get married. </p>
	<p begin="00:00:31.30" dur="00:00:03.50">He visited every home in the village...looking for the right girl.  </p>
	<p begin="00:00:35.50" dur="00:00:06.00">Then, with one look at Abeer, he ran home to tell his mother he'd found his bride.  </p>
	<p begin="00:00:41.55" dur="00:00:03.60">They didn’t meet again until just before their Muslim wedding.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:47.50" dur="00:00:06.20">"The first time I saw her, when the sheik came to sign the book I looked at her picture to make sure it was her."</p>
	<p begin="00:00:60.30" dur="00:00:05.60">After the bride and groom sign special legal papers, 7 days of celebration begin.  </p>
	<p begin="00:00:66.30" dur="00:00:05.00">Each day, early in the morning the party moves out into the village streets.  </p>
	<p begin="00:00:72.50" dur="00:00:03.30">The bride is painted from head to toe with henna.  </p>
	<p begin="00:00:76.40" dur="00:00:07.00">One day before the ceremony, the groom's bed is taken outside to be bathed in sandalwood incense.  </p>
	<p begin="00:00:84.00" dur="00:00:05.50">Sheriff is also perfumed...the scents, will last for weeks. </p>
	<p begin="00:00:92.00" dur="00:00:07.00">The Nubians traditionally lived along the banks of the Nile River in what is now southern Egypt and the Sudan.  </p>
	<p begin="00:00:100.00" dur="00:00:03.00">But in the 1960's that changed.  </p>
	<p begin="00:00:103.10" dur="00:00:06.80">The government of Egypt built the Aswan Dam and the water covered the ancient lands of the Nubian people.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:110.70" dur="00:00:03.00">This man had to move here at the age of 12.  </p>
	<p begin="00:00:114.20" dur="00:00:04.00">His family left their mud-brick home for one of cement built by the government.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:118.30" dur="00:00:08.00">"Even though there in the old village there was no electricity, or means of transportation like we have here now...still life there was better."</p>
	<p begin="00:00:126.30" dur="00:00:07.45">"There we used to keep our Nubian traditions and Nubian language.  Nubian language could be endangered here today."</p>
	<p begin="00:00:135.50" dur="00:00:06.80">On the final night of the wedding - the village eats a feast of meat and rice in front of the groom's house.  </p>
	<p begin="00:00:142.50" dur="00:00:06.00">Then the groom leaves his parents' home and leads his neighbors through the streets chanting Islamic songs.  </p>
	<p begin="00:00:149.00" dur="00:00:05.80">Well after midnight, the groom at last picks up the bride and they arrive at the party.  </p>
	<p begin="00:00:155.20" dur="00:00:04.80">They spend all night dancing and singing from sunset to noon.   </p>
	<p begin="00:00:161.20" dur="00:00:03.80">The word "Nubia" comes from an ancient term for "gold"... </p>
	<p begin="00:00:165.05" dur="00:00:04.00">and refers to the gold mines for which the area was once famous. </p>
	<p begin="00:00:170.00" dur="00:00:02.70">That gold still shines today... </p>
	<p begin="00:00:173.20" dur="00:00:02.50">as the bride is draped with jewelry... </p>
	<p begin="00:00:175.30" dur="00:00:02.00">just like a queen.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:178.10" dur="00:00:05.50">It’s now past 3 in the morning...but by Nubian standards the party has just begun.  </p>
	<p begin="00:00:186.00" dur="00:00:06.50">After the exchange of rings, mother kisses her son and his new bride as they begin their life together... </p>
	<p begin="00:00:192.70" dur="00:00:02.30">carrying on their ancient customs... </p>
	<p begin="00:00:195.05" dur="00:00:04.00">and celebrating a joyful transition in their lives.</p>
