	<p begin="00:00:01.30" dur="00:00:04.30">To say Mongolians are very good at horseback riding would be an understatement.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:06.00" dur="00:00:06.00">They learn to ride when they're very young, and people all over the world think that they’re great horsemen.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:12.00" dur="00:00:08.00">Almost a thousand years ago, Mongolia became a very large and important country, because it had a strong army that rode horses.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:21.00" dur="00:00:03.50">Since that time, life in Mongolia has changed a lot.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:24.50" dur="00:00:04.10">However, horses are still very important to the people here.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:29.00" dur="00:00:03.00">Mongolians often move from place to place.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:32.00" dur="00:00:06.00">Because there are few roads and cars there, people still need horses every day for their way of life.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:38.50" dur="00:00:08.30">Each year in July, there is a festival called Naadam that celebrates horseback riding and other traditional Mongolian sports.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:47.30" dur="00:00:06.00">Thousands of people come from all over Mongolia to a place just outside the capital city, Ulan Bator.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:54.00" dur="00:00:07.20">This festival has important national events in traditional Mongolian sports—especially horse racing.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:61.50" dur="00:00:07.10">However, the Naadam race is a little unusual. All of the riders in the race are younger than 12 years old!</p>
	<p begin="00:00:69.40" dur="00:00:04.10">People start preparing for the race early in the morning.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:74.00" dur="00:00:02.30">Each horse’s tail is covered in leather.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:76.40" dur="00:00:04.00">Then, they offer horse’s milk to the spirits of nature.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:81.30" dur="00:00:06.00">And there are ceremonies to protect the riders and their horses from accidents, and to give them good luck.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:87.30" dur="00:00:04.00">Before the race, the parents join the young riders to walk around a special area.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:93.00" dur="00:00:04.30">It's a big race—about 500 riders will participate in it.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:98.30" dur="00:00:07.00">However, before the race starts, the riders have to walk the horses over 15 miles to the starting point.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:106.20" dur="00:00:01.30">The race begins.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:108.00" dur="00:00:03.50">Thousands of people wait at the finish line, but they can’t see anything.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:112.20" dur="00:00:03.00">The race is actually happening miles away.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:116.00" dur="00:00:03.20">The people who are watching want to get near the winning horses. </p>
	<p begin="00:00:119.30" dur="00:00:04.00">An old story says that the dust when the horses run is lucky.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:124.30" dur="00:00:04.30">People believe it brings happiness and success to anybody it touches.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:129.30" dur="00:00:08.00">Finally, the first horses and riders appear. These first riders have already been running for nearly 30 minutes!</p>
	<p begin="00:00:137.30" dur="00:00:04.30">The first five horses that finish the race get a blue sash for winning.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:143.10" dur="00:00:05.00">After the winners have arrived, the other horses and riders keep coming in for another hour.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:148.30" dur="00:00:06.20">Finally, the Naadam race ends in the National Stadium, the country’s main sports ground.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:154.50" dur="00:00:04.10">A famous singer sings about the winning horses and how good they are.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:159.20" dur="00:00:06.00">The five winners walk around the sports ground. They receive prizes and drink horse’s milk.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:165.70" dur="00:00:05.00">And the slowest horse gets a prize too, so that he will try harder next time.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:170.70" dur="00:00:05.20">The young riders have shown their skills in one of Mongolia’s most important traditions.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:176.00" dur="00:00:03.50">They are the next great horsemen of their country.</p>
