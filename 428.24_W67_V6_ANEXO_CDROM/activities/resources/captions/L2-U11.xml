<p begin="00:00:02.90" dur="00:00:03.00">It's early morning on the tropical island of Trinidad. </p>
<p begin="00:00:06.03" dur="00:00:06.50">Tropical birds are everywhere; calling and showing their beautiful colors among the different greens of the island.</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.10" dur="00:00:04.40">Ornithologist and photographer Roger Neckles is up early with them.</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.94" dur="00:00:04.20">For the past ten years, Neckles has been taking photographs of the island’s birds.</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.04" dur="00:00:03.00">“We just got buzzed by a hummingbird. Did you hear that?”</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.02" dur="00:00:05.50">It’s clear that Neckles really loves the place. He describes it as being like heaven.</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.08" dur="00:00:05.20">He talks about how incredibly beautiful Trinidad is with its many colorful flowers and birds.</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.80" dur="00:00:02.60">To Neckles, it feels just like paradise...</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.75" dur="00:00:03.40">“This is the best time of the day for me, getting up at five o’clock in the morning...</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.75" dur="00:00:02.90">heading off into the sticks up in the mountains."</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.00" dur="00:00:04.00">"The atmosphere . . . the temperature up here . . . it’s just fantastic!"</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.01" dur="00:00:03.20">"You breathe pure oxygen! This is the typical day in the ‘office’ for me.” </p>
<p begin="00:01:05.00" dur="00:00:06.50">Neckles works at the Asa Wright Nature Center, which attracts ornithologists and bird lovers from all over the world.</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.90" dur="00:00:04.80">Most people go there to view some of the world's most attractive and special birds.</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.94" dur="00:00:02.80">However, the birds move very quickly.</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.08" dur="00:00:04.50">Neckles has to be very fast, too or he'll miss his opportunity to photograph them.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.10" dur="00:00:02.30">"Ahh...look at that Purple Honey Creeper! Whoa!"</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.92" dur="00:00:04.50">"The color is so unique, a fantastic shade of purple."</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.07" dur="00:00:04.00">There are about 460 different types of birds on the island</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.09" dur="00:00:02.80">and Neckles is trying to photograph them all.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.99" dur="00:00:01.50">But this takes time.</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.50" dur="00:00:02.00">He has to wait for just the right moment.</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.99" dur="00:00:04.50">“If you are not prepared to wait for the shot, you won’t get it.”</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.60" dur="00:00:03.30">Neckles has studied hummingbird behavior for a long time.</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.30" dur="00:00:02.30">"Come on, talk to me."</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.94" dur="00:00:03.30">He knows most things about their way of life, including where they live.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.92" dur="00:00:05.00">Hummingbirds live in very unusual nests that they build using their beaks and feet.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.05" dur="00:00:04.30">“And they’re really strong, they build them on the edges...the very edges of the branches,</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.97" dur="00:00:05.00">and winds come, hurricanes will come, and gale force winds, and they wouldn't blow down.”</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.05" dur="00:00:04.00">Why has Neckles chosen to study birds in Trinidad and Tobago?</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.03" dur="00:00:05.70">"I came here in 1978, and was so enchanted with the topography of</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.10" dur="00:00:03.75">the land here in Trinidad and Tobago that I thought, 'Oh yes! I could do this.'"</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.00" dur="00:00:05.50">Through his research, Neckles has developed a deeper understanding of all the wildlife of the island - </p>
<p begin="00:02:49.50" dur="00:00:01.30">even the ones that aren’t so pretty.</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.20" dur="00:00:02.00">"Whoa! You don't want to get your fingers in there!"</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.03" dur="00:00:05.50">However, it's not just any wildlife that brings Neckles into the woods again and again.</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.88" dur="00:00:01.00">It's the birds.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.09" dur="00:00:05.00">This morning he hopes to get a photograph of a very small - and very rare - bird.</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.00" dur="00:00:07.50">“Look at this! This is the most festive hummingbird in Trinidad and Tobago!"</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.89" dur="00:00:04.20">"The smallest hummingbird in Trinidad and Tobago - the Tufted Coquette." </p>
<p begin="00:03:19.49" dur="00:00:01.30">"Look at him just sitting there!” </p>
<p begin="00:03:20.95" dur="00:00:03.70">He's been trying to photograph this bird for six weeks.</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.75" dur="00:00:04.00">It's been a very long wait, and now it comes down to one chance...</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.89" dur="00:00:03.00">Neckles has finally gotten the shot that he has been seeking.</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.03" dur="00:00:03.00">"I’ve got goose bumps all up my arms. This is fantastic!”</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.98" dur="00:00:04.00">Neckles doesn’t mind waiting for the perfect moment to take a photograph. </p>
<p begin="00:03:45.17" dur="00:00:05.00">Like the birds he follows, he enjoys the day and the beauty around him. </p>
<p begin="00:03:51.17" dur="00:00:06.00">“I have no plans to give this up at all because I figure I could do this for the rest of my life."</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.17" dur="00:00:04.00">"Every time I go out I see something new.”</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.97" dur="00:00:05.50">Apparently, the birds of Trinidad aren’t the only ones who have found paradise.</p>
