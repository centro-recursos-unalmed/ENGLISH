	<p begin="00:00:01.40" dur="00:00:10.00">Beneath the hot skillet surface of the outback, where the baked soil crumbles like ashes, there are treasures to be found.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:12.10" dur="00:00:08.10">In endless warrens of burrowing and hope, every hour of every day you can find people digging.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:24.50" dur="00:00:04.00">And virtually all of these individuals are like Peter Rowe.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:28.50" dur="00:00:05.00">"And I came here to make a million dollars, I heard you could make a million dollars in Coober Pedy, and I come to get my share of it."</p>
	<p begin="00:00:33.50" dur="00:00:02.10">That could only be one thing.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:36.00" dur="00:00:02.00">"To find opal."</p>
	<p begin="00:00:39.00" dur="00:00:06.00">"That’s what they came here for...to find that elusive, beautiful gem that just sort of bounces out and says 'Hey, look at me.'"</p>
	<p begin="00:00:46.20" dur="00:00:05.30">The town of Coober Pedy is home to about three thousand people.  </p>
	<p begin="00:00:51.50" dur="00:00:02.40">It was built on opals.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:56.40" dur="00:00:10.40">Over ninety percent of the world’s opals come from Australia, and the first ones on this continent were discovered right here in 1911.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:67.00" dur="00:00:06.20">Finding opal has been turned into as much of a science as the rock will allow.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:73.30" dur="00:00:05.30">This team has been digging for a year and a half since their last significant payoff.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:79.00" dur="00:00:04.00">They believe they are only a few feet away from a major find.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:85.00" dur="00:00:09.00">The problem is, in this town, almost everyone, almost every day believes he is on the verge of finding a fortune.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:95.50" dur="00:00:02.00">Something like this: </p>
	<p begin="00:00:98.20" dur="00:00:09.30">these opals were all cut out of the same fist-sized piece of rock and will sell for at least three hundred thousand dollars, maybe a lot more.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:108.00" dur="00:00:07.00">But here’s the thing, ninety-five percent of all opal is colorless--worthless.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:115.40" dur="00:00:05.00">This maze of tunnels did not produce even a dollar’s worth of opal.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:121.50" dur="00:00:08.50">One of the odd benefits of digging so many holes in search of opals, is that some of them can be converted into homes. </p>
	<p begin="00:00:130.50" dur="00:00:05.10">But it is the mother load payoff that is on everybody’s mind.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:136.00" dur="00:00:05.40">“Within a mile of where we’re sitting now, there could be millions of dollars. There is millions of dollars."</p>
	<p begin="00:00:141.40" dur="00:00:06.20">"And there’s stones that would knock your eye out. Gems that would be just astronomical."</p>
	<p begin="00:00:148.00" dur="00:00:03.00">"And most of them never get seen; never see the light of day.”</p>
	<p begin="00:00:151.00" dur="00:00:06.00">Out here, where holes in the ground pass for buildings, most people do not find their fortunes.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:159.00" dur="00:00:06.40">At the end of this day that started with so much hope, these miners came up empty again.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:167.00" dur="00:00:10.00">The odds are, as long as they keep questing for opals, this will be the course of their lives for all the hopes, dreams, and hard work--</p>
	<p begin="00:00:177.30" dur="00:00:04.00">scratching a living out of the ground.</p>
