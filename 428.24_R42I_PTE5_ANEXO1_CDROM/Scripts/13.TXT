Unit 13: A visit to Mount Rushmore

A young couple tries to get to one of the United States' most
famous monuments - before the sun goes down.

Susan: 		All right. I think that's everything. Are you
		ready to go?

Jim: 		I think so. Um . . . wait.

Susan: 		What?

Jim: 		Where's the map?

Susan: 		What map?

Jim: 		The map to Mount Rushmore.

Susan: 		I don't have a map.

Jim: 		Well, me neither.

Susan: 		Well, we can buy one at a gas station. Let's go! 

Jim: 		First, we need film.

Susan: 		Not now. We can get some later. Let's go. OK?
		It's already three o'clock. I want to see Mount
		Rushmore.

Jim: 		OK, let's go.

Jim: 		Excuse me. Do you have any maps?

Attendant: 	Maps to . . .

Jim: 		To Mount Rushmore.

Attendant: 	No, but I can give you directions.

Jim: 		Great!

Attendant: 	Do you want the scenic route?

Jim: 		Uh, sure. Sure, that sounds great.

Attendant: 	OK. Take Highway 44 west, out of town.

Susan: 		OK.

Attendant: 	Then turn left on 385.

Jim: 		Highway 385.

Attendant: 	Uh-huh. Then take 244 east, and follow the 
		signs to Mount Rushmore.

Jim: 		OK. Thanks a lot.

Susan: 		Yeah, thanks.

Jim: 		How far is it?

Attendant: 	It's about fifty miles.

Jim: 		Fifty miles. Thanks. . . . Do you have any film?

Attendant: 	No, but you can get some at the convenience
		store right across the street.

Jim: 		Thanks.

Susan: 		Oh, right. Film.

Jim: 		I'll get it. . . . OK, here's the film.

Susan: 		Great! We can get some good photos in this
		light. Let's hurry.

Jim: 		Uh, Susan? I'm kind of hungry.

Susan: 		Hungry?

Jim: 		Yeah. Can we stop and get something to eat?

Susan: 		Jim!

Jim: 		Something quick. Some fast food.

Susan: 		OK.

Jim: 		All right. Just a minute. . . . Excuse me. Is
		there a fast-food restaurant near here?

Attendant: 	Yeah, there's a place on Main. If you go up
		to the red light, turn left, and go three
		blocks, you can't miss it.

Jim: 		Thanks. . . . OK. Now let's go to Mount
		Rushmore.

Susan: 		I hope we get there before dark. It's already
		four o'clock!

Jim: 		Oh, don't worry.

Susan: 		What's the road?

Jim: 		Highway 44. We take it east out of town.

Susan: 		East?

Jim: 		Yeah, east.

		*	*	*

Susan: 		Jim, I think we're going the wrong way.

Jim: 		Um, I think you're right. . . . What time is it?

Susan: 		About five-thirty. 

Jim: 		There's 385.

Susan: 		And we're going to turn . . . 

Jim: 		Left.

Susan: 		Are you sure?

Jim: 		Yeah, . . . I'm sure.

Susan: 		No, I think it's right.

Jim: 		Right?

Susan: 		Yeah, I'm sure. Right. . . . 

Jim: 		Oh, . . . 

Susan: 		What, Jim?

Jim: 		We're lost.

Susan: 		I know. . . . This isn't right. Where's 244?

Jim: 		I don't know.

Susan: 		Let's go back. 

		*	*	*

Susan: 		There's a sign!

Jim: 		And there it is!

Susan: 		Where? I can't see anything. 

Jim: 		So, . . . let's come back tomorrow?

Susan: 		Yeah, why not? Now we know how to get here.
