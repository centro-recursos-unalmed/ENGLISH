Unit 15: Hollywood then and now

After we hear a short history of the movie industry, young
people talk about their dreams of success in Hollywood.

Jim: 		Arnold Schwarzenegger . . . Marilyn Monroe . . . 
		Eddie Murphy . . . Elizabeth Taylor. . . . This is
		Hollywood. . . . Hi, my name is Jim Hodson, and today
		we're in Hollywood, California, the home of American
		movies then and now. American movies are popular
		throughout the world. But how did it all start? . .
		Well, moviemaking actually began back in 1903. The
		movie was "The Great Train Robbery." . . . Early movies
		were in black and white. They had no sound. People
		watched the movie and read the story. A piano player
		played along with the movie. . . . In 1927, "The
		Jazz Singer" changed everything. It was the first 
		movie with sound. . . . Then, in 1939, "Gone With the
		Wind" changed everything again. It was the first movie
		in color. . . Hollywood made hundreds of movies every
		year. . . . A few of these movies became classics. 
		And a few actors and actresses became stars. . . .
		Today Hollywood is still the home of American
		movies, and each year people come to Hollywood from 
		all over the country and the world. Many of them 
		come as tourists, but some have dreams. They want 
		to be stars, and they come to Hollywood to find a 
		job in the movies. Let's talk with some of them.
