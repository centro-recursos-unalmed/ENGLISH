Dr. North: 	Come in. Mr. Lewis. How are you?

Mr. Lewis: 	Fine, thanks.

Dr. North: 	What's the problem today?

Mr. Lewis: 	It's my ear. I have an earache.

Dr. North: 	Well, let's have a look. Please sit down over
		here. Is it the right ear or the left?

Mr. Lewis: 	It's the right one.

Dr. North: 	OK now. Let's see. Mmm. Yes. . . . Yep. Do you
		swim, Mr. Lewis?

Mr. Lewis: 	Yes, I do. I swim every morning.

Dr. North: 	Well, I'm going to give you these ear drops 
		. . . and some pills.

Mr. Lewis: 	Thanks, Doctor.

Dr. North: 	Take the pills every day for a week. Use the
		drops every morning. And don't swim for a week.

Dr. North: 	No. Oh, it's my back.

Mr. Lewis: 	Don't worry, Doctor. I can help.

Dr. North: 	You can?

Mr. Lewis: 	Yes, I can. You see, my father has a bad back
		and I help him all the time. I'm very good at
		this. Here. . . . How's that?

Dr. North: 	Much better. Oh, thank you.

Mr. Lewis: 	Now, Doctor, lie down on the table.

Dr. North: 	OK.

Mr. Lewis: 	Now, bend your knees and put your feet up on 
		the table.

Dr. North: 	Like this?
