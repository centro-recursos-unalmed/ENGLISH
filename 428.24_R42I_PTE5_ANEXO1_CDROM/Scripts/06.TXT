Unit 6: Day and night

Andi introduces us to her busy life: she's a police officer during
the week and a singer on the weekends.

Andi: 	Hi. My name's Andi. I'm twenty-three. This is my house. I 
	live here with my mom and my dad and my sister, Susan. 
	Susan is seventeen. She's a high school student. It's OK 
	here, really. This is my room. Nice, huh? Weekdays, I get
	up about six. Then I have breakfast with my family. Then 
	I go to work.

	*	*	*

	I drive to work. I'm a police officer.

	*	*	*

	This is the police station. I start at nine o'clock. It's 
	a great job.

	*	*	*

	I work outside. I work with people.

	*	*	*

	At noon, I usually go to lunch.

	*	*	*

	At one o'clock, I work again. At five, I go home.

	*	*	*

	Weekday nights, I stay home. I eat dinner. I read, I 
	watch TV. I talk with Susan. Every night is the same.
	But weekends are different.

	*	*	*

	Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, I work at Ivories. I start 
	at nine o'clock. I'm a singer! 

	*	*	*

	But on Monday, I'm a police officer.
