Unit 16: The perfect date

Kate finds it's not easy to get the perfect date - even when 
there are plenty of dating opportunities.

Ben: 			So, Kate, it's the weekend. What are you
			going to do?

Kate: 			I don't know. I really want to go to the
			Spiders concert, but I need a ticket. And
			Maggie's having a party, but -

Ben: 			But?

Kate: 			But I don't want to go. I can't. Dan's
			going to call. 

Ben: 			Dan?

Kate: 			Yeah. He's this great guy in my art class. 

Ben: 			But what happened to Greg? And Tony?

Kate: 			Oh, Greg? He's boring. And Tony? I don't
			know. He's kind of . . . 

Ben: 			[phone rings] Maybe that's Dan.

Kate: 			Don't answer it. Wait!

Answering machine:	We can't come to the phone right now. So
			please leave your name and phone number
			after the beep. We'll call you back soon.

Maggie: 		[leaving message] Hi, Kate. This is Maggie.
			I'm going to have a small party at my house
			tonight.

Ben: 			Kate!

Maggie: 		[leaving message] Do you want to come?

Kate: 			[picking up phone] Hi, Maggie. How are you?

Maggie: 		Oh, Kate! Hi. Fine, thanks. Listen, I'm
			going to have a small party at my house
			tonight. Do you want to come?

Kate: 			Oh, Maggie, I'd love to come, but . . . I
			have a really bad cold. 

Maggie: 		Oh, that's too bad. I hope you feel better.

Kate: 			Thanks, Maggie. Bye. . . . [phone rings]
			Ben, no!

Ben: 			Don't worry. [picks up phone] Hello?

Greg: 			Hi. This is Greg. Is Kate there?

Ben: 			Just a moment. [to Kate] It's Greg. Are you
			home?

Kate: 			I guess. [takes phone] Hi, Greg.

Greg: 			Hi, Kate. What are you doing?

Kate: 			Studying. Why?

Greg: 			Well, Maggie's going to have a party
			tonight. Do you want to go?

Kate: 			Uh, gee, Greg, I can't. I have to study. 
			You know me. I need to study.

Greg: 			Oh, well . . .

Kate: 			Sorry, Greg. Thanks. Bye.

Greg: 			Bye, Kate.

Kate: 			[phone rings] Hello?

Tony: 			Hi, Kate?

Kate: 			Yes?

Tony: 			It's Tony.

Kate: 			Oh. . . . Hi, Tony. How are you?

Tony: 			I'm great! Uh, listen. There's a party at
			Maggie's tonight. Do you want to go?

Kate: 			A party? Gee, Tony, I don't think so. I
			just, um, started a new book!

Tony: 			A new book?

Kate: 			Yeah, I'm reading it right now! Maybe next
			time?

Tony: 			OK, Kate. See you.

Kate: 			Sorry.

Ben: 			A new book? [phone rings] I'm not going to
			answer it.

			art class and . . .

Kate:			[picking up phone] Dan? Hi. This is Kate.
			How are you?

Dan:			I'm great. Kate, Maggie's brother just gave
			me two tickets to the Spiders concert. Do
			you want to go?

Kate: 			The Spiders concert? I'd love to go.

Dan: 			That's fantastic! Listen, I'm at Maggie's.
			Can you meet me here?
