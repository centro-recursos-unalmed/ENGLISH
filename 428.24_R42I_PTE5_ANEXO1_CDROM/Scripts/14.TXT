Unit 14: Home alone

During lunch, Rick tells George about his disastrous weekend.

George: 	Hi, Rick. How was your weekend?

Rick: 		My weekend? It was terrible!

George: 	Really? What happened?

Rick: 		Do you really want to know?

George: 	Of course.

Rick: 		Well, on Saturday, my mom and dad went away
		for the day.

George: 	Yeah?

		*	*	*

Rick's mother: 	There's a pizza in the refrigerator.

Rick: 		Uh-huh.

Rick's father: 	And here's the number at Aunt Helen's.

Rick: 		Thanks, Dad.

Rick's mother: 	Cook the pizza for fifteen minutes.

Rick's father: 	See you at eleven tonight.

Rick's mother: 	And don't burn it.

Rick: 		OK. All right. See you tonight. Bye.

		*	*	*

George: 	So, what happened?

Rick: 		Well, they left at one o'clock, and I was
		hungry.

George: 	Uh-huh.

Rick: 		So I put a pizza in the oven.

George: 	Yeah?

Rick: 		And then I called Julia on the phone. We talked
		for about an hour.

George: 	Uh-oh.

Rick: 		Uh-oh is right. . . . 

George: 	So what did you do?

Rick: 		I ran back upstairs, and I called the fire
		department.

		*	*	*

Rick: 		Yes, 2525 Perry Avenue. Fire! Hurry!

		*	*	*

George: 	Did a fire truck come?

Rick: 		Yes, it did. And the firemen put the fire out.

George: 	Oh. Well, that's good.

Rick: 		No, that's bad. There was water all over the
		kitchen. . . . 

Kate: 		Did you clean it up?

Rick: 		Yeah, I cleaned it up. It took two hours -
		from two to four o'clock.

George: 	So, then what did you do?

Rick: 		Do you really want to know?

George: 	Of course!

Rick: 		Well, I was really hungry.

George: 	Uh-huh.

Rick: 		So I went to the store to get a pizza.

George: 	Yeah?

Rick: 		And I drove there in my dad's new car.

George: 	Oh no!

Rick: 		Oh, yes. I got back, and guess what! I drove
		the car into the garage door. . . .

George: 	Oh! Was your father angry?

Rick: 		Well, my parents came home late that night, but
		the next day . . . 

George: 	And what about your mother?

Rick: 		She thanked me.

George: 	She thanked you?

Rick: 		Yeah! She said, "The kitchen . . . it's so
		clean!"

George: 	Well, anyway, that's good. So what did you do 
		on Sunday?

Rick: 		I found a part-time job . . . at the pizza shop.

George: 	The pizza shop? You?

Rick: 		Yeah! Garage doors are expensive, George. And I
		need the money.

George: 	Well, cheer up, Rick. I'll buy you an ice cream.

Rick: 		Gee, thanks, George. . . . So, George, how was
		your weekend?

George: 	Oh, my weekend was fantastic! First, . . .
