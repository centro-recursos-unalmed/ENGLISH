<p begin="00:00:01.00" dur="00:00:05.55">It's a cool, sunny day in Borrego Springs, California and Eleanor Shimeall is cooking food.</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.95" dur="00:00:03.00">She isn't using electricity, gas, charcoal,</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.05" dur="00:00:01.80">or wood to cook her food.</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.00" dur="00:00:04.50">Instead, Shimeall is using the sun to make her lunch.</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.80" dur="00:00:05.50">"I'm going to check on this chicken and rice and see how it's...whether it's cooking."</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.50" dur="00:00:02.00">"Ah, it's doing a good job."</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.05" dur="00:00:04.50">In fact, she's made this entire delicious meal with solar power.</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.10" dur="00:00:05.50">A solar cooker needs only the light from the sun to cook meat, fish, grains, and vegetables - </p>
<p begin="00:00:37.35" dur="00:00:02.50">even if the air temperature isn't very hot.</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.25" dur="00:00:03.00">This method is popular with people who are worried about the environment.</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.15" dur="00:00:03.90">Solar cooking does not use fossil fuels and it does not cause pollution.</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.05" dur="00:00:04.10">However, in developing countries, solar cookers can save lives.</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.30" dur="00:00:03.00">"With sunshine you have an alternative to fire."</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.25" dur="00:00:03.60">"And that's important for two and a half billion people to learn about</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.00" dur="00:00:02.00">because they're running out of traditional fuels."</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.20" dur="00:00:05.00">Dr. Bob Metcalf is a microbiologist and a founding member of Solar Cookers International.</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.20" dur="00:00:03.20">Solar Cookers International promotes solar cooking worldwide,</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.40" dur="00:00:02.50">especially in the developing countries of Africa.</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.75" dur="00:00:04.70">Their goals are to stop deforestation and to make women's lives easier.</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.05" dur="00:00:04.10">"They have to walk about two to three miles or so to collect wood."</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.30" dur="00:00:01.70">"And then they have to tend the fire."</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.50" dur="00:00:03.40">"And the smoke from that fire, it burns their eyes and chokes their lungs."</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.65" dur="00:00:02.00">According to the World Health Organization,</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.30" dur="00:00:04.30">smoke from wood fires causes the deaths of two million women and children each year.</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.25" dur="00:00:04.30">More than 22,000 families now cook traditional foods with the sun.</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.75" dur="00:00:01.75">"This is good. It's very good!"</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.05" dur="00:00:04.30">The consistency is good; the texture is fine. No problem!</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.10" dur="00:00:02.90">"We're all amazed that a cardboard box can cook."</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.80" dur="00:00:04.00">After each workshop, attendees get their own portable solar "cook kits."</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.05" dur="00:00:03.20">The simple cookers cost about five dollars and last almost two years.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.55" dur="00:00:04.90">"Shiny things direct the sunshine onto a dark pot that then absorbs the sunshine,</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.65" dur="00:00:02.80">and changes that light energy into heat energy."</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.75" dur="00:00:04.80">"And heat energy doesn't get out of the clear plastic bag; it doesn't get out of the window."</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.05" dur="00:00:06.00">SCI reports that solar cooking is also an effective way to make water pure and safe to drink.</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.15" dur="00:00:05.00">"Six thousand people a day are going to die of waterborne diseases in developing countries."</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.15" dur="00:00:05.10">"If you heat water to 65° Celsius, 149° Fahrenheit,</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.55" dur="00:00:03.20">you can pasteurize water and make it safe to drink."</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.05" dur="00:00:03.40">Solar Cookers International has developed a useful measuring tool</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.45" dur="00:00:03.25">that helps people to know when water is safe to drink.</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.75" dur="00:00:02.95">"If the water gets hot enough to melt this wax,</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.90" dur="00:00:03.00">the water has reached pasteurization temperatures."</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.50" dur="00:00:04.00">From Nepal to Nicaragua, solar cooking projects are helping people</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.60" dur="00:00:03.00">in nearly every country in the developing world.</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.66" dur="00:00:05.30">Solar Cookers International's goal is to increase the use of solar cookers everywhere.</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.66" dur="00:00:04.10">"Science is supposed to help and benefit all of mankind,</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.99" dur="00:00:02.20">and you've got something that is good science</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.10" dur="00:00:03.00">that could help two and a half billion people in the world."</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.85" dur="00:00:03.20">"There's a great need for information that these things work."</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.65" dur="00:00:02.35">"OK, solar cooker!"</p>
