<p begin="00:00:03.35" dur="00:00:03.50">From inside a spacecraft, the Earth and space look beautiful.</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.20" dur="00:00:06.00">But outside the spacecraft – in space – it is a different and far more dangerous world.</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.00" dur="00:00:04.30">There is no oxygen to breathe and there is dangerous radiation.</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.30" dur="00:00:07.30">Also temperatures can drop to minus 120 degrees Celcius and rise to 120 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.10" dur="00:00:02.40">But man has conquered this environment.</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.00" dur="00:00:05.00">In order to survive in space, astronauts have to wear space suits.</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.00" dur="00:00:06.50">The space suits are made from a very strong material and it is filled with oxygen so the astronauts can breathe.</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.50" dur="00:00:07.00">The first person to leave a spacecraft and "walk" in space was Soviet Cosmonaut, Alesksy Leonov, in 1965.</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.00" dur="00:00:03.00">He "walked" in space for 12 minutes.</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.40" dur="00:00:06.20">A few months later, astronaut Edward White became the first American to walk in space during the Gemini IV mission.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.00" dur="00:00:06.30">These early spacewalks were intended to discover if it is possible for man to survive in deep space.</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.30" dur="00:00:04.50">They were successful - man can survive in space.</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.30" dur="00:00:04.00">Now spacewalks are an everyday part of the space shuttle missions.</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.40" dur="00:00:04.35">Astronauts take spacewalks in order to do jobs that they can’t do from inside the shuttle. </p>
<p begin="00:01:30.10" dur="00:00:04.10">For example, they have fixed the solar panels on the Hubble Space Telescope</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.15" dur="00:00:04.10">and they are the construction workers for the International Space Station.</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.30" dur="00:00:03.00">But still, spacewalks are dangerous. </p>
<p begin="00:01:46.00" dur="00:00:05.00">Astronauts work in pairs so if one astronaut has problems, the other astronaut can help.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.40" dur="00:00:06.00">They are connected to the spacecraft so that they cannot float off into space and lose contact with the spacecraft.</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.30" dur="00:00:04.10">It is not easy to work in a space suit. It is difficult to hold tools in the big gloves.</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.30" dur="00:00:05.00">Also the astronauts are weightless and this makes it difficult to work as well.</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.20" dur="00:00:04.30">So, how can the astronauts practice their spacewalks on Earth before they go into space? </p>
<p begin="00:02:15.10" dur="00:00:02.50">The answer is – underwater.</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.00" dur="00:00:06.00">At NASA’s Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, the astronauts can practice jobs that they will later do in space.</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.00" dur="00:00:07.00">Their space suits are adjusted so that they do not sink to the bottom of the tank or float to the top of the water – they are weightless.</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.00" dur="00:00:02.50">They spend a lot of time practicing in the tank.</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.10" dur="00:00:04.40">For every hour that they will spend walking in space, they spend 10 hours practicing underwater.</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.30" dur="00:00:05.30">As NASA moves forward on the maintenance and construction of the International Space Station, </p>
<p begin="00:02:47.00" dur="00:00:03.00">spacewalks will continue to be important.</p>
