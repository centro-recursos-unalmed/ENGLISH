<p begin="00:00:01.50" dur="00:00:03.50">Mount Kilimanjaro is often called the "roof of Africa".</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.00" dur="00:00:06.30">It rises 19,340 feet, or nearly four miles, into the sky and is</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.30" dur="00:00:03.30">the highest point of the African continent.</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.30" dur="00:00:04.00">Kilimanjaro is in northeastern Tanzania in East Africa.</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.00" dur="00:00:08.20">It lies almost exactly between the cities of Cairo, Egypt, to the north and Cape Town, South Africa, to the south.</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.20" dur="00:00:06.00">It's around 220 miles south of the equator, in a hot, tropical region of the world.</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.20" dur="00:00:07.00">The impressive snow-covered peaks of Kilimanjaro have been an inspiration to visitors for a very long time.</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.20" dur="00:00:06.20">Over the years, thousands of people have traveled to Tanzania to climb this majestic mountain.</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.50" dur="00:00:03.50">Many others have come to view its famous glacier-covered peak.</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.00" dur="00:00:03.50">One of these visitors was an American writer named Ernest Hemingway.</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.00" dur="00:00:02.50">He wrote a story about the mountain that made it famous.</p>
<p begin="00:00:61.20" dur="00:00:06.00">The story, first published in 1936, is called "The Snows of Kilimanjaro".</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.20" dur="00:00:06.30">In the story, Hemingway describes the mountain's glaciers as "wide as all the world," "great," "high," and</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.50" dur="00:00:02.00">"unbelievably white in the sun."</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.20" dur="00:00:03.00">Although the ice cap is fantastic to see,</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.20" dur="00:00:02.70">it does in fact have a much more important purpose.</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.30" dur="00:00:03.20">The glaciers were formed more than 11,000 years ago.</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.50" dur="00:00:06.00">They have become an important source of water for drinking and farming for people who live near Kilimanjaro.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.00" dur="00:00:05.40">Unfortunately, for the last 100 years the snows of Kilimanjaro have been disappearing.</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.35" dur="00:00:05.50">Since 1912, Kilimanjaro's glaciers have gotten more than 80 percent smaller.</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.20" dur="00:00:04.45">A NASA satellite has been taking pictures of the mountain's ice cap for more than 15 years.</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.20" dur="00:00:04.10">The pictures that were taken in 1993 are very different from</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.30" dur="00:00:03.20">those taken only seven years later, in the year 2000. </p>
<p begin="00:01:61.45" dur="00:00:04.20">There are many ideas about why Kilimanjaro's snow is melting so quickly.</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.00" dur="00:00:02.90">For one thing, the mountain is in a tropical region,</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.30" dur="00:00:04.30">so the glaciers are at risk for the negative effects of climate change.</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.50" dur="00:00:04.50">One type of climate change that may be directly affecting Kilimanjaro is called global warming.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.10" dur="00:00:04.30">As the world's temperatures rise, the snows melt.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.50" dur="00:00:04.30">Deforestation is another possible reason why Kilimanjaro's glaciers are melting.</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.00" dur="00:00:06.30">When trees are cut down in large numbers, the effects can cause changes in the atmosphere and the climate. </p>
<p begin="00:02:40.00" dur="00:00:04.00">Trees keep the air cooler and help maintain the water levels in the atmosphere.</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.10" dur="00:00:03.10">This helps to create clouds and rain and snow. </p>
<p begin="00:02:50.30" dur="00:00:04.80">Less rain and snow and increased temperatures can cause the glaciers to melt.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.40" dur="00:00:06.20">Whatever the causes may be, the snows of Kilimanjaro are continuing to melt at a very fast rate.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.20" dur="00:00:05.40">Experts now predict that the mountain's glaciers could completely disappear by the year 2020.</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.10" dur="00:00:06.10">The loss of Kilimanjaro's glaciers would likely cause many problems for the area around the mountain.</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.50" dur="00:00:04.50">It would remove an important source of water for the people who live on or near the mountain.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.00" dur="00:00:06.20">It could also reduce the number of tourists who come to Tanzania to see the mountain, and the money that they bring to the country. </p>
<p begin="00:03:28.30" dur="00:00:03.50">The missing snows of Mount Kilimanjaro may be a warning.</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.30" dur="00:00:05.00">They definitely show people all over the world the dangers of climate change and deforestation.</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.00" dur="00:00:04.00">Hopefully people will learn from the loss of Kilimanjaro's glaciers.</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.95" dur="00:00:06.50">Sadly, the majestic snows of Kilimanjaro may not be around forever for people to enjoy.</p>
