<p begin="00:00:03.30" dur="00:00:02.50">"Hello, good morning..."</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.30" dur="00:00:04.50">Six o’clock in the morning and the stress of everyday life begins...</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.20" dur="00:00:03.20">family...home...work...over and over again.</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.50" dur="00:00:04.30">This kind of stress actually gives us energy to get through the day.</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.30" dur="00:00:03.10">But doing it day after day can damage our bodies.</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.40" dur="00:00:08.20">To find out what all that stress is doing to a body, let’s go to the Neuro-Endocrinology lab at Arizona State University.</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.00" dur="00:00:05.00">Kathy Matt and her team of researchers are trying to find out what stress does to our bodies.</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.00" dur="00:00:06.00">"Stress, good or bad - it's not just psychological, it’s physiological as well."</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.00" dur="00:00:04.00">So, your body produces chemicals, called hormones, when you feel stress.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.00" dur="00:00:04.00">"In these samples, we are measuring cortisol which is a stress hormone."</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.00" dur="00:00:05.00">The hormones that your body produces give you energy so that you can manage the stress.</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.30" dur="00:00:03.30">Dr. Matt explains that there are two types of stress.</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.30" dur="00:00:05.00">Physical stress, like running and mental stress, like too much work.</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.30" dur="00:00:03.00">In physical stress, your body burns the hormones.</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.40" dur="00:00:03.50">In mental stress, your body doesn’t burn all the hormones.</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.30" dur="00:00:02.00">"Put this over your head."</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.30" dur="00:00:03.10">The effects of physical stress on the body are easy to measure...</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.40" dur="00:00:03.00">"I’m going to take you up 2 ½ percent...OK?"</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.00" dur="00:00:04.00">As the speed of the treadmill goes up, so does the heart rate and breathing.</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.00" dur="00:00:01.30">"All right here we go..."</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.40" dur="00:00:03.30">Right now the hormones in the blood are rising higher and higher.</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.20" dur="00:00:01.30">"Here you go all you got..."</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.20" dur="00:00:05.20">This woman is releasing many hormones and using all of the energy they create.</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.20" dur="00:00:01.40">"Good job, way to go!"</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.20" dur="00:00:03.30">So she passes the first test. Her body deals with the physical stress pretty well.</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.00" dur="00:00:02.00">But what about mental stress?</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.00" dur="00:00:05.00">"It’s vital that you perform at your highest capable level for each of the tests."</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.20" dur="00:00:01.40">With the pressure on...</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.00" dur="00:00:02.00">"Come on, Allysa, as fast as you can..."</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.00" dur="00:00:04.00">the heart races...the blood pressure soars...</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.00" dur="00:00:03.30">"God I hate the 8s. I can’t do the 8 times table."</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.30" dur="00:00:02.00">Again those stress hormones are kicking in.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.30" dur="00:00:02.30">"eight . . . "</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.00" dur="00:00:07.00">When you are under long term mental stress, your body produces hormones all the time, but it doesn’t burn the extra fuel...</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.00" dur="00:00:02.50">and that leads to all sorts of problems.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.00" dur="00:00:02.00">"I want you to put your fingers straight down."</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.00" dur="00:00:02.30">This machine checks if your bones are in good shape.</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.30" dur="00:00:05.00">If you have too many hormones in your blood, you can have problems with your bones.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.20" dur="00:00:05.00">Other studies show that long term stress can lead to diabetes, heart disease and neurological diseases.</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.00" dur="00:00:04.50">"Here’s your bone density. So you’re really right on in this norm."</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.00" dur="00:00:06.00">So far so good. She shows no long-term effects from mental stress...yet.</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.00" dur="00:00:03.00">But that doesn’t mean she can just ignore it.</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.30" dur="00:00:07.00">This means that if you do lots of exercise it will burn up the hormones and your body won’t have so many problems from mental stress.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.00" dur="00:00:02.40">And remember, not all stress is bad.</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.50" dur="00:00:06.00">Every now and then we need a good dose of those hormones to help us get to the end of the day.</p>
