<p begin="00:00:03.40" dur="00:00:06.00">In parts of South Africa, there are still big herds of wild animals like zebras,</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.00" dur="00:00:02.00">elephants,</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.30" dur="00:00:02.00">and giraffes.</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.90" dur="00:00:06.20">But today many of these animals are in danger because people are taking the land that animals need.</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.20" dur="00:00:03.90">Conservationists are people who protect wildlife and nature.</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.55" dur="00:00:03.95">And many of them are now leading a fight to save these animals.</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.90" dur="00:00:03.50">Louis Liebenberg is one of these conservationists.</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.40" dur="00:00:05.30">"The most important thing is to try and get an understanding of what's happening out there."</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.35" dur="00:00:03.80">Liebenberg reports that people need to know more about animals.</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.15" dur="00:00:05.00">He says that people need to understand what happens to plants and animals over time.</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.30" dur="00:00:03.00">Are they increasing or decreasing in numbers?</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.20" dur="00:00:02.00">What plants are the animals eating?</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.20" dur="00:00:04.90">For hundreds of years, African Bushmen have been very good wild animal trackers.</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.20" dur="00:00:04.15">They know what the animals eat, where they go, and where they sleep.</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.50" dur="00:00:05.40">But, they don't always speak the same language as the conservationists so it can be difficult to communicate.</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.10" dur="00:00:04.30">Now, Liebenberg has brought an invention to the Karoo National Park.</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.55" dur="00:00:02.70">It's called the Cyber Tracker.</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.80" dur="00:00:05.40">He hopes that together, the Cyber Tracker and the Bushmen can help protect the animals.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.10" dur="00:00:09.80">Liebenberg explains that the Cyber Tracker is a small computer that helps collect information about animals with pictures, called "icons," instead of words.</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.50" dur="00:00:05.00">That way, the Bushmen can record what they see even without words.</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.10" dur="00:00:05.90">According to Liebenberg, the Cyber Tracker can collect very detailed and complicated information.</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.45" dur="00:00:02.00">And it can do it very quickly.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.35" dur="00:00:03.60">The Cyber Tracker also contains a global positioning device.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.85" dur="00:00:05.60">Each time a Bushman sees something interesting about an animal or plant, he pushes a button.</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.65" dur="00:00:03.00">The Cyber Tracker records exactly where the man is.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.45" dur="00:00:05.50">That way, even if the man can't read or write, he can record what he sees and where.</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.65" dur="00:00:06.20">Liebenberg explains that the Cyber Tracker uses icons, or pictures, to communicate.</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.05" dur="00:00:06.20">There are pictures for drinking, walking, fighting, sleeping, eating, and other things.</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.75" dur="00:00:04.40">The user can report whether an animal is sick or dead, too.</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.05" dur="00:00:03.30">The Bushman can also record other meanings by pushing different buttons.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.35" dur="00:00:03.00">With this option, they can name about 50 different plants.</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.05" dur="00:00:03.40">"Three females, three youngsters and one male."</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.85" dur="00:00:03.55">Liebenberg adds that the human factor is very important.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.50" dur="00:00:05.70">A big part of using the Cyber Tracker is the Bushman's ability to understand and record what he sees.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.00" dur="00:00:05.00">When the trackers return to their base, they connect the Cyber Tracker to a personal computer.</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.40" dur="00:00:03.20">Then, Liebenberg uses the information to make maps.</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.20" dur="00:00:05.80">These maps show where the animal herds are, what they are eating, and what their health is like.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.25" dur="00:00:03.30">The Cyber Tracker project started several years ago.</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.95" dur="00:00:03.30">At first, the idea was to help a few animals in danger.</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.00" dur="00:00:06.20">Now, more and more people have started using the Cyber Tracker in African parks, and with different animals.</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.60" dur="00:00:04.00">Recently, Liebenberg put the Cyber Tracker software on the Internet.</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.20" dur="00:00:05.75">Many conservationists around the world have started adding the technology to their conservation programs.</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.50" dur="00:00:04.40">Soon, the Cyber Tracker may be able to help wild animals everywhere!</p>
