<p begin="00:00:02.35" dur="00:00:03.25">In this ancient city, change comes slowly.</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.65" dur="00:00:06.00">Narrow stone streets are almost the same as they were when the Medici family ruled more than 500 years ago.</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.45" dur="00:00:04.30">The Industrial Revolution, world wars and a flood forced change,</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.90" dur="00:00:02.20">but one factory has not changed.</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.60" dur="00:00:05.10">At the "Antico Setificio Fiorentino" or the Antique Silk Factory of Florence</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.25" dur="00:00:03.40">the sounds of mechanical looms remind us of the past.</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.60" dur="00:00:06.30">These noisy 19th century looms create some of the world's finest silk fabrics for drapery and upholstery.</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.20" dur="00:00:02.40">But here they are the new machines.</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.60" dur="00:00:03.20">On the other side of the factory are the real pieces of history.</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.00" dur="00:00:04.85">Stefano Benelli weaves silk fabric that machines cannot create.</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.25" dur="00:00:04.00">And he does it slowly and carefully, one thread at a time.</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.75" dur="00:00:06.50">These looms were built in 1780 and they use the same principles of weaving used for centuries before that.</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.65" dur="00:00:03.50">"Everything is done like it was done in the ancient time."</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.35" dur="00:00:04.20">"But we continue to do an evolution, continuously."</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.85" dur="00:00:04.00">"We invent, we create continuously but using the old looms."</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.85" dur="00:00:04.20">All the other factories threw away their old hand looms after World War II.</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.55" dur="00:00:02.80">Only the Setificio now uses hand looms.</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.55" dur="00:00:04.10">Usually silk has 3 to 4 thousand threads running in one direction,</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.15" dur="00:00:04.15">but the silk produced on the antique hand looms has 12,000 threads.</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.30" dur="00:00:02.80">It is much stronger and more beautiful.</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.60" dur="00:00:03.70">Fabric from the Setificio cannot be found in stores and catalogs -</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.40" dur="00:00:01.10">it is custom made.</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.00" dur="00:00:06.00">Some people may think that making silk on a hand loom is difficult and boring but Benelli enjoys it.</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.40" dur="00:00:02.00">"To the mind, is OK."</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.70" dur="00:00:03.00">"Not stressful, yes."</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.75" dur="00:00:03.70">Perhaps no other city on earth has preserved the grandeur</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.75" dur="00:00:03.40">and the grace of the Renaissance as well as Florence.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.45" dur="00:00:04.30">It is appropriate then that here, at the "Antico Setificio Fiorentino"</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.75" dur="00:00:03.00">style and tradition are woven together.</p>
