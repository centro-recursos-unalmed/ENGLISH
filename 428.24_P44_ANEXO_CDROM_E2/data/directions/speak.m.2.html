This section tests your ability to speak about different topics. You will answer three questions. Answer each one as completely as you can.<br><br>
Question 1 will be about a familiar topic. Try to speak about the topic clearly and coherently.<br><br>
Question 2 will include reading and listening. First, you will read a short passage about a topic. Then the text will disappear, and you will hear a talk about the same topic. Next you will answer a question about the passage and the talk. Try to answer the question clearly and coherently to show that you understood the passage and the talk.<br><br>
Question 3 will include part of a conversation or a lecture and a question. Try to answer the question clearly and coherently, using information from the conversation or lecture.<br><br>
While you read and listen, you can take notes. You can use your notes to help you answer the questions.<br><br>
Listen closely to the directions for each question. They will not appear on the screen.<br><br>
You will have a short time to prepare your response to each question. You can see how much preparation time remains by looking at a clock at the top of the screen. When no preparation time remains, you will be told to begin your response. The clock will show how much time you have to record your response. You will see a message on the screen when no response time remains.
