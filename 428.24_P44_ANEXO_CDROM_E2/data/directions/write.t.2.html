For this task, you will read a passage about an academic topic. You have <b>3 minutes</b> to read the passage, and then the passage will disappear. Then you will hear a lecture about the same topic. You can take notes while you read and listen.<br><br>
You will then write an answer to a question about the relationship between the reading passage and the lecture. Try to use information from the passage and the lecture to answer the question. You will <b>not</b> be asked for your personal opinion. You can see the reading passage again when you are ready to write. You can use your notes to help you. You have <b>20 minutes</b> to write your response.<br><br>
A successful answer will usually be around 150 to 225 words. Try to show that you can write well and give complete, accurate information. If you finish your response early, you can click on <b>Next</b> to finish this section and begin the second writing task.<br><br>
Now you will read the passage. Remember that you can see it again when you write your response. As soon as the reading time ends, the lecture will begin. Keep your headset on until the lecture ends.
