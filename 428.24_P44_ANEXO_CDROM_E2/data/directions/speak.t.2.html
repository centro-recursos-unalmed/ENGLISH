This section tests your ability to speak about different topics. You will answer six questions. Answer each one as completely as you can.<br><br>
Questions 1 and 2 will be about familiar topics. Try to speak about the topics clearly and coherently.<br><br>
Questions 3 and 4 will include reading and listening.  First, you will read a short passage. Then the text will disappear, and you will hear a talk about the same topic. Next you will answer a question about the text and the talk. Try to use information from the text and the talk to answer the question clearly and coherently to show that you understood the text and the talk.<br><br>
Questions 5 and 6 will include part of a conversation or a lecture and a question. Try to answer the question clearly and coherently, using information from the conversation or lecture.<br><br>
While you read and listen, you may take notes. You can use your notes to help you answer the questions.<br><br>
Listen closely to the directions for each question. They will not appear on the screen.<br><br>
You will have a short time to prepare your response to each question. You can see how much preparation time remains by looking at a clock at the top of the screen. When no preparation time remains, you will be told to begin your response. The clock will show how much time you have to record your response. You will see a message on the screen when no response time remains.
