This section tests your ability to understand an English academic reading passage.<br><br>
You can see how much time remains by looking at a clock at the top of the screen.<br><br>
All questions except the last one are worth one point each. The last question is worth more than one point. The directions for the last question will state how many points it is worth.<br><br>
In some passages, you will see a word or phrase <font color=blue><u>underlined in blue</u></font>. You can click on the word or phrase for a definition or an explanation.<br><br>
Click on <b>Next</b> to go to the next question. You can skip questions and return back to them later if time remains. Click on <b>Back</b> to go back to previous questions.<br><br>
Click on <b>Review</b> at any time to see the questions you have answered and the questions you have not answered. From the review screen, you can go back to any previous question.<br><br>
You will now start the Reading section. You have <b>20 minutes</b> to read one passage and answer the questions about it.<br><br>
Click on <b>Continue</b> to start.
