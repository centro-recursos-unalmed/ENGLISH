The colony had been established in 1587, when 117 men, women, and children from England landed on the island and set up a colony under the leadership of Governor John White.<br/>White remained in the colony for about a month when, recognizing that the colony was facing an extreme shortage of food and supplies, he decided to return to England to obtain much-needed resources. He was unable to return to the colony immediately because England and Spain were at war and the war was causing disruptions to transportation by ship over the Atlantic. When he was finally able to return to the colony in 1590, all of the colonists were gone, including his own daughter, his son-in-law, and his granddaugther. Before departing for England, White had given the colonists instructions to carve their new location somewhere conspicuous if they had to move elsewhere while he was gone. When White returned to Roanoke Island, the colonists were all gone, and the letters "Cro" were carved on one of the trees, and the word "Croatan" was carved onto a fence post. White never saw his missing family members again or learned of their fate.<br/>Clearly, the colonists had carved these messages before leaving Roanoke Island, but what happened to the colonists afterward was a mystery. One theory about the colonists' whereabouts is that they moved to a different island. Croatan is the name of an island close to Roanoke Island. The carvings "Cro" and "Croatan" that were left by the missing colonists seem to suggest that the colonists left Roanoke Island and moved to the neighboring island of Croatan.</passage-text></passage>
