Well. I'd like to make a point now, a really important point for you to understand. This important point is that the conflict approach is not the only approach in explaining the development of human personality. Instead, there are various approaches.<br/><br/>I'm going to talk now about an approach to personality development that differs considerably from the conflict approach. The approach I'm going to talk about now is the fulfillment approach.<br/><br/>According to the fulfillment approach, life is not a conflict between battling forces. Instead, there is a single force within a person. This single force is the need for fulfillment, the need to have a satisfying life. A person spends his or her life trying to figure out what he or she wants and then putting in efforts ranging from almost none to an extraordinary amount trying to reach those goals. According to this view of personality development, personality is shaped by the image that a person has of the most desirable kind of life and by the successes and failures he or she has in working toward that kind of life. In this view, it is not the life that one actually has that determines one's personality. Instead, it is how well the life one has matches the life one has envisioned and how hard one has worked to reach the envisioned life that shapes personality.</paragraph></page></script>
