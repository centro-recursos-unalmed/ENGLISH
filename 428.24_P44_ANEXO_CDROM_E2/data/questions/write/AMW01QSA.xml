Because the colonists carved the letters "Cro" on a tree and the word "Croatan" on a fence post before they disappeared, a theory has been proposed that the colonists went to the nearby island of Croatan when they disappeared from Roanoke Island.<br/><tab/>The listening passage casts doubt on the theory that the colonists went to nearby Croatan Island by listing the reasons that this mostly likely did not occur. The first reason that the colonists most likely did not go to Croatan Island is that this island has been searched numerous times and no remnants of the colonists have ever been found there. The second reason that the colonists may not have gone to Croatan Island is that Croatan is a name that was given to a number of places and tribes and not only to one island. The third reason that the colonists may not have gone to Croatan Island is that they may have gone elsewhere and intermixed with a tribe of people who sometimes called themselves Croatans. This tribe had members who could read and write in English and had English features such as light hair and eyes, and this seems to show that English people intermixed with them.</sample-answer-text></essay>
