Do you think that the A.O. Smith Corporation was satisfied with the results of the wage piece system it had instituted?  I mean, after all, the company had expected workers to increase the number of pieces they produced, and this did happen: workers did increase the number of car frames they produced.  In addition, the company had expected workers to be satisfied with the program because they were producing more pieces and were therefore receiving increased pay, and this did happen, too: when workers received additional pay, they could only be happy with higher paychecks.<br/><br/>Well, in reality, A.O. Smith ended up being completely dissatisfied with the results of the piecework wage system.  The reason for this dissatisfaction with the system had to do with the quality of the car frames that were being turned out.  When workers were being paid based on the number of car frames they produced, they tended to produce the frames too quickly, and the quality of the frames suffered.  Overall, under this system, the number of frames produced increased, but the quality of the frames decreased considerably.  In the neighborhood of 20 percent of the frames had to be repaired before they could be shipped to car manufacturers.  The end result was that the piecework wage system that had been instituted in the early 1980s was replaced with a different system in the late 1980s.  Under the system that replaced the piecework wage system, defective car frames, the ones that needed to be repaired before they could be sent to car manufacturers, were reduced from 20 percent to only 3 percent.</paragraph></page></script>
