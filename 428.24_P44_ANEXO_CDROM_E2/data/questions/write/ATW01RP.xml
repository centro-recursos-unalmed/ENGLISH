The conflict approach is based on the idea that every person is in a perpetual state of conflict. The forces that cause continuous conflict in a person may be competing forces within that person. Examples of this type of internal conflict abound in everyday life when a person, from the moment the alarm goes off, has to deal with issues between getting up or calling in sick, between wearing the uncomfortable formal suit or more comfortable casual clothes, between having a healthy breakfast or a less healthy but delicious one, between hurrying to get to the office on time or accepting one more late arrival. A person's continuous state of conflict may also result when external forces outside the person are in conflict with the person's internal forces. When a child wants to stay up late to watch television and the parents will not allow it, there is conflict; when a worker wants to work on a task in a certain way and the boss will not allow it, there is conflict; when a person wants to live in a way that is contrary to the mores of society and society deals harshly with this person, there is conflict.<br/>What should be understood from this view of personality development is that it looks at life as a never-ending series of conflicts from the moment one is born until the moment he or she dies. In this view, personality develops as a result of how a person deals with the conflicts that make up life. Everyone has conflicts, but everyone does not deal with them in the same way. It is the differences in how various people deal with conflict that cause personalities to differ.</passage-text></passage>
