A piecework wage system is a system in which pay is based on the number of pieces a worker produces. The company expected that this new system would result in an increase in productivity by workers, because their pay would be based on the number of car frames they produced, and an increase in morale, because workers would receive  increased pay. These two expected results were initially achieved.<br/><tab/>The listening passage challenges the system by explaining that, while the initial results of the system seemed satisfactory, the long-term results were unsatisfactory. Productivity and morale had initially been high, but a serious problem arose when there was a tremendous decrease in the quality of the car frames that were produced and 20 percent of the frames required repairs. Because of this decrease in the quality of the frames that were produced, the company felt it was necessary to replace the piecework wage system with a new system, one that resulted in only 3 percent of the car frames needing repairs.</sample-answer-text></essay>
