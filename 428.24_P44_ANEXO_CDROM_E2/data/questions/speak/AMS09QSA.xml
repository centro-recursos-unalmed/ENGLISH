The professor then goes on to provide an example of a problem with the use of the noun "man," which can also be used in a countable or an uncountable way. In 1969, when Neil Armstrong first took a step on the Moon, he said, "One small step for a man&#8230;;" he used "man" in the countable sense meaning that one man took a step, which is exactly what had happened. However, when the words were transmitted to Earth, there was a problem with the transmission, and people on Earth heard him say, "One small step for man&#8230;" without the article and with "man" used in the uncountable sense meaning "humanity." The meaning that people heard on Earth didn't make sense because it wasn't all of humanity that took the step on the Moon; it was just one man.</sample-answer-text></essay>
