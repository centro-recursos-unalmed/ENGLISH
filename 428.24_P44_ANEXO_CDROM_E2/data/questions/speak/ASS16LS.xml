We'll also be talking about the orbit of Pluto, which is generally not considered a planet now, in part because of its unusual orbit. The eight inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, all have rather circular orbits. Their orbits are concentric circles, one inside the other. The orbit of Pluto, in contrast, is rather elliptical, which means that it is longer and narrower than the orbits of the eight inner planets.<br/><br/>Let's talk a little bit more about the orbits of Neptune and Pluto. As I just said, Neptune takes a rounder path around the Sun, and Pluto takes a longer and narrower path around the Sun. Something unusual happens because Pluto has a much longer and narrower orbit than Neptune does: the orbit of Pluto sometimes moves inside of the orbit of Neptune, which would put Pluto closer to the Sun than the planet Neptune. This happens every 248 years and lasts for about twenty years. It was in 1979 that the orbit of Pluto moved inside the orbit of Neptune, and it stayed inside Neptune's orbit for twenty years and then moved outside Neptune's orbit in 1999. Pluto's orbit won't move inside Neptune's orbit again for several centuries.<br/><br/>Astronomers aren't certain why the orbit of Pluto is so different from the orbits of the eight inner planets. However, the fact that Pluto's orbit is so different from the orbits of the eight inner planets has led to the conclusion that Pluto may really not be a planet. Pluto is a small solid chunk, and this is quite different from the outer planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, which are large and gaseous. According to a theory that is prevalent today, Pluto may have been one of Neptune's moons rather than a planet orbiting around the Sun. As one of Neptune's moons, Pluto would have been in orbit around Neptune rather than around the Sun, but then it somehow escaped Neptune's gravitational pull and moved into a rather unusual elliptical orbit around the Sun.</paragraph></page></script>
