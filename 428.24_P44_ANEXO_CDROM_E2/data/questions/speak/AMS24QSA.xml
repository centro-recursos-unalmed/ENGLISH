It is a very hard statistics course that he has to take, and she has already taken it.<br/><br/>He can take the course in either the summer or the fall. In the summer, the course is very condensed; the whole course is taught in only two weeks. In the fall, the course is spread out over ten weeks.<br/><br/>The woman recommends to him to take the course in the fall, over ten weeks instead of two weeks, and I agree with her. It's a very hard course, and because it's so hard, it's better to spread it out over ten weeks in the fall. Only certain courses, courses that are really easy, are good to take in a very short time.</sample-answer-text></essay>
