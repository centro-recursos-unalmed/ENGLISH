<font size=16><b>How do I send data to my teacher?</b></font><br>
<p>
In the Send Data section of the program you will be able to send your latest scores, question data, writing responses, and recordings to your teacher via e-mail. You can update all your data each time you send.<br><br>
Your computer must have an Internet connection to send your data. Before sending, ask your teacher for her or his correct e-mail address and your class name.<br><br>
All of your Results Reports, Skills Reports, and writing responses will automatically be updated each time you send, but you must choose which Speaking section recordings to send.<br>   
<p><br>
<font color=#6F2C91><b>Selecting Recordings</b></font><br><br>
Recordings you have saved in the Speaking sections will be listed in the chart on the Send Data screen. Only recordings you select will be sent. If you did not save your recordings in the Speaking section, they will not appear on this list.<br><br>
Click on <b>Play</b>&nbsp;<img src='$IMAGE/1.gif' border=0>  to listen to the recording before you select it.</b><br><br>
The Date Sent column&nbsp;<img src='$IMAGE/2.gif' border=0>  shows if you have already sent that recording to your teacher. If there was a problem with a recording already sent, you may choose to send it again.<br><br>
Click on a box&nbsp;<img src='$IMAGE/3.gif' border=0> to select the recordings you want to send. You can select as many recordings as you wish.  Remember, the more recordings you select, the longer it will take to send.<br><br>
Click on <b>Continue</b>&nbsp;<img src='$IMAGE/4.gif' border=0> when you have made your selections and you are ready to enter your e-mail information.<br>

<p>
You may click on <b>Stop</b>&nbsp;<img src='$IMAGE/5.gif' border=0> to cancel the transmission if necessary.<br>
The program may have sent part of your data before you canceled. The next time you enter the Send Data section, the recordings chart will show whether some of the recordings were sent before you canceled the transmission.<br><br>
The program will give you a message when the data has been sent and you may return to the main menu.<br><br>
