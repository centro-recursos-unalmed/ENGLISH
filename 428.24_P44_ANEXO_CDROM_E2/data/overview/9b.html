<font size=16><b>How do I set up my microphone and save my recordings on a Macintosh computer?</b></font><br>
<p>
If you wish to use your computer to record your Speaking responses in this program, you will need a computer microphone. Please note that you can also use other recording devices (for example, tape recorders) if you do not have a computer microphone. However, only recordings saved on your computer can be emailed to your teacher. The instructions that follow explain how to set up a computer microphone.<br><br>
For information on how to record your voice in the Speaking section once your microphone is set up, select, "How do I use the Speaking section?" in the Overview Menu.<br><br>
Your computer should have a connection to plug in a microphone (either a traditional microphone jack or a USB port). Some computers (especially laptop computers) have built-in microphones. A computer microphone can be purchased at many stores. We recommend that you use a combination headset (with microphone and speakers) to listen and record.<br><br>

<p>
To save your recording, follow these steps:<br><br>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Skill-Assessment Checklist screen, click on the <b>Save Recording</b> button.&nbsp;<img src='$IMAGE/6.gif' border=0><br><br>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "Save Recording" dialog box (Screen 4), use the navigation area&nbsp;<img src='$IMAGE/7.gif' border=0> to select the folder in which to save the recording.<br><br>
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;We recommend that you keep the default file name&nbsp;<img src='$IMAGE/8.gif' border=0> so that it is easy to know from which activity the recording was done. The end of the file name indicates how many attempts you have made at the speaking activity (for example, "A1" means "Attempt 1").<br><br>
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Click on the <b>Save</b> button to save your recording.&nbsp;<img src='$IMAGE/9.gif' border=0>

<i>Screen 4: Save Recording Dialog Box</i>
<p>
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each speaking file that you wish to save must be saved individually using steps 1 to 4 above.<br><br>
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;To listen to a saved recording, go to the folder in which you save your recording. Double-click on the file you wish to hear. The file will open in QuickTime.<br><br>
<font size=16 color=#6F2C91><b>Other Notes and Recommendations</b></font><br><br>
<img src='$IMAGE/dot.gif' border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;We recommend that you save your recordings to a drive that includes a lot of space. A floppy disc, for example, is quite small and only holds a few recording files.  a high capacity removable drive, such as a Flash drive or Zip drive will have a much larger capacity.<br><br>
<img src='$IMAGE/dot.gif' border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;We recommend that you save your recordings in a folder location that will not change. The program will remember your saved recordings if they remain in their original saved location. You may hear your previously saved recordings by reviewing your work in the "Results" section of the program.<br><br>
<img src='$IMAGE/dot.gif' border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;If your file cannot be located, you can browse to find the file. Once it has been located, the program will once again remember where the recording is saved.<br><br>
