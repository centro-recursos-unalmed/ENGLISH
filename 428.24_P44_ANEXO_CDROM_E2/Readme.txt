(E) STARTING THE PROGRAM

The first screen of the Longman iBT Prep 2.0 CD-ROM offers three ways to start the program:

1. New User - if you have never used the program before.

2. Local User - if you have already used the program on this computer.

3. Disk User - if you have used the program on this computer or on a different computer and have your score data stored on a floppy disk or other portable storage device.
 

(F) USING THE PROGRAM
 
You can use this program in two (2) ways.

1. One person on the same computer for each session

For this method, a floppy disk or other portable storage device is NOT necessary, and you do not need to do anything to save your score data when you exit the program. The computer will automatically save your scores and your completed questions.

* Start your first session by selecting "New User."
* Start each following session by selecting "Local User."
* At the end of each session, your data will automatically be saved on the computer. 

PLEASE NOTE: Starting a session as a New User or as a Disk User will delete all previously saved data on the computer.

2. More than one person on the same computer or one person on different computers

A floppy disk or other portable storage device is necessary for saving score data if more than one person uses the program on the same computer. A person who uses the software on different computers will also need a floppy disk or another portable storage device for saving data.

* Insert a floppy disk or attach another portable storage device. 
* Start your first session by selecting "New User."
* Start each following session by selecting "Disk User."
* At the Log Out screen, click on the "Copy Data" button to save your data to the floppy disk or another portable storage device.
