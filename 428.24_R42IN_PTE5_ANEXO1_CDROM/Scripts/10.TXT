Unit 10	Mistaken identity

A receptionist makes a mistake and sends two men to the wrong 
job interviews.

Jenny: 		Thank you. McDouglas Hamburgers. May I help you?
		No, he isn't in right now. Certainly. I'll give
		him the message. Good-bye.

Martha: 	Well, I have one more person to see for the 
		manager's job.

Jenny: 		OK. What's his name?

Martha: 	David Jones. This is his application. Will you 
		see if he can come in for an interview tomorrow
		morning . . . oh, around 10:15?
	
Jenny: 		10:15. Sure. I'll take care of it.

Martha: 	Well, thank you, Jenny.

Bob: 		Oh, Martha. Before you go, there's something I
		need to talk to you about.

Martha: 	What is it, Bob?

Bob: 		I think we need to hire a clown.

Martha: 	You know, so do I. All the other restaurants 
		have one.

Bob: 		That's great! I have something to show you . . . 
		What do you think?

Martha: 	It's perfect!

Bob: 		I'm glad you like it. Listen, I'd really like 
		to have someone by Saturday.

Jenny: 		Saturday! But that's only three days away.

Martha: 	Jenny, didn't we just get a resume from someone
		with clown experience?

Jenny: 		Yes, I think so. Yes, here it is.

Martha: 	Oh, Bob, take a look at this.

Bob: 		Oh . . . looks good. Jenny, see if this guy can 
		come in tomorrow for an interview - say about 
		ten o'clock?

Jenny: 		Sure, Mr. Anderson. What's his name?

Bob: 		Greg Jones.

Jenny: 		Mr. Jones. About ten o'clock?

Bob: 		Yes, that's right. Thank you. This is going to 
		be great.

Martha: 	I'm so excited.

Jenny: 		OK, let's see. The clown job. David Jones . . .
		822-1793.

David: 		Hi. I'm here for the job interview. My name is
		David Jones.

Jenny: 		Oh, yes. Mr. Jones. I'll let Mr. Anderson know
		you're here.

David: 		Thanks.

Jenny: 		Uh-huh. Mr. Anderson, Mr. Jones is here.

Bob: 		Thanks. Send him in.

Jenny: 		OK. You can go right on in. It's the second door
		on the left.

David: 		Thanks.

Bob: 		Come in. Hello, Mr. Jones. I'm Bob Anderson.

David: 		It's nice to meet you, Mr. Anderson.

Bob: 		Please have a seat.

David: 		Thank you.

Bob: 		Well, let's get right down to business. What 
		made you apply for this position?

David: 		Well, I love the restaurant business, and I 
		think I'm good with people.

Bob: 		How about children?

David: 		Well, yes, I do like children. I suppose I like
		working with people of all ages. I'm very 
		patient.

Bob: 		Good. That's important.

Greg: 		Hi. My name is Greg Jones. I have an appointment
		for a job interview.

Jenny: 		Oh, yes. Mr. Jones. I'll let Ms. Bennett know
		you're here.

Greg: 		Thanks.

Jenny: 		Uh-huh. Ms. Bennett, Mr. Jones is here.

Martha: 	Thank you, Jenny. Send him in.

Jenny: 		OK. You can go right on in. It's the first door 
		on the right.

Greg: 		Thank you.

Martha: 	Come in.

Greg: 		Hello. Ms. Bennett?

Martha: 	Yes. Please take a seat.

Greg: 		Thanks. Where would you like me to take it?

Martha: 	Very funny, Mr. Jones. It is Jones, isn't it?

Greg: 		Yes, that's right.

Martha: 	Tell me about your experience.

Greg: 		Well, I worked on weekends while I was in 
		school.

Martha: 	Did you enjoy the work?

Greg: 		Yes. And my boss told me that I was very good at
		it.

Martha: 	Really. Well, we need someone who's very good 
		with money.

Greg: 		No problem. Do you see this dollar bill?

Martha: 	Yes.

Greg: 		It's just an ordinary bill.

Martha: 	Yes, I can see that, but . . .

Greg: 		There! As you can see, I'm very good with money.

Martha: 	Very interesting. So this is the kind of
		management they're teaching in college today, 
		huh?

Greg: 		Yes. And the most useful management technique I
		learned was this.

Martha: 	Mr. Jones!

		*	*	*

Bob: 		Well, we're really looking for someone who can
		make people laugh.

David: 		Well, yes, I think laughter is good for people. 
		It helps them relax.

Bob: 		Why don't you show me what you can do with 
		these?

David: 		Gee, how did you know I could use these? It's 
		not on my resume.

Bob: 		Hey, you're pretty good. In fact, I think you're
		just the person . . .

Martha: 	Bob, can I speak to you for a moment?

Bob: 		Well, I'm kind of in the middle of an interview,
		Martha. The clown job, remember?

Martha: 	That's what I need to talk to you about.

Bob: 		Well, sure . . . I guess.

Martha: 	Bob Anderson, I'd like you to meet Greg Jones, 
		the applicant for the clown job.

Bob: 		The what? Well, if he's here for the clown job,
		then who's he?

David: 		David Jones. I applied for the manager's job.

Martha: 	I guess Jenny mixed up the files.

Bob: 		I can't believe it. I almost hired a manager to 
		be a clown!

Martha: 	Well, I almost hired a clown to be my manager!
