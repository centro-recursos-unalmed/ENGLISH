Unit 16	A wonderful evening

A young man meets his girlfriend's parents for the first time.

Mother: 	Josh, would you set the table, please? It's
		almost time for dinner.

Josh: 		Sure, Mom.

		*	*	*

Bob: 		Well, how do I look?

Mother: 	Fine, just fine. You look very nice.

Bob: 		Are you sure? Is this tie OK?

Mother: 	You look great. There's no reason to be nervous.

Bob: 		But I'm meeting Helen's parents for the first
		time.

Mother: 	Don't worry. I'm sure they're very nice.
		Everything will be OK.

Josh: 		How about a game of Scrabble before you go? It
		will help you relax.

Bob: 		Thanks, Josh, but you know I don't like
		Scrabble. Besides, I really have to leave.

Mother: 	Well, are you sure you don't want to try some of
		my fish stew first? It's that recipe I saw in
		the paper yesterday.

Bob: 		Mom, you know I don't like fish stew!

Mother: 	Well, OK. Have a good evening. And good luck!

Bob: 		Thanks. I'll need it.

Helen: 		Hi, Bob.

Bob: 		Hi, Helen.

Helen: 		Come on in.

Bob: 		Thanks. This is for you.

Helen: 		Oh, thanks. How sweet! Can I open it now?

Bob: 		Of course.

Helen: 		This is one of my favorite perfumes.

Bob: 		I'm glad you like it.

Helen: 		Come in and meet my parents.

Bob: 		OK.

Helen: 		Mom, Dad, I'd like you to meet Bob.

Mother: 	Very nice to meet you, Bob. We've heard so much
		about you.

Father: 	Yes, Helen talks about you all the time.

Bob: 		It's nice to meet you both. These are for you.

Mother: 	Well, thank you, Bob. Oh, they're lovely. Uh-oh. 
		I hear something in the kitchen. If you'll
		excuse me, . . .

Bob: 		Sure.

Father: 	Well, come on over and have a seat.

Bob: 		Thanks.

Father: 	So, what do you plan to do when you graduate,
		Bob?

Bob: 		I'm not sure yet. I'm really interested in the
		theater.

Father: 	Oh, but you don't want to be an actor. There's
		no future in it. Have you thought about law or
		medicine? I keep telling Helen that she should
		go into law.

Bob: 		Law. Yes, I've been thinking about law, too,
		actually. I think I may try to get into law
		school.

Father: 	Now that is an excellent idea. Well, you two
		just sit and relax. I'm going to go in the
		kitchen and help out.

Helen: 		I knew you and Dad would get along. He's such a
		sweetie, isn't he?

Bob: 		Yes, he is.

		*	*	*

Mother: 	I'm so glad that you could join us, Bob. Now, 
		let me show you what we've been working on all
		day.

Bob: 		It smells delicious.

Father: 	It's a new recipe I found in the paper
		yesterday. I hope you like fish stew, Bob.

Bob: 		Oh, yes. It's one of my favorite dishes.

Mother: 	Oh, I'm so pleased. Well, why doesn't everybody
		sit down? Thank you.

Bob: 		Thank you.

Mother: 	I hope you enjoy it.

		*	*	*

Mother: 	Did you enjoy the stew, Bob?

Bob: 		It was great, thanks.

Mother: 	Oh, I'm so glad. Here, let me give you some
		more.

Bob: 		Well, umm . . . it was so good, I guess I could 		
		eat just a little more.

Mother: 	Oh, of course. There you go.

Bob: 		Thank you.

		*	*	*

Mother: 	Well, why don't we all go into the living room
		and relax?

Helen: 		That sounds like a great idea.

Father: 	Great.

Mother: 	And I know just what to do next. I'll be right
		back.

Helen: 		So, are you enjoying yourself?

Bob: 		Oh, very much. Your parents are wonderful.

		*	*	*

Mother: 	All right. Is everybody ready? You do know how
		to play Scrabble, don't you?

Bob: 		Actually, it's one of my favorite games.

Father: 	Great! I knew this was going to be a wonderful
		evening.

Mother: 	Well, let's get started.

Helen: 		Let's see who goes first.
