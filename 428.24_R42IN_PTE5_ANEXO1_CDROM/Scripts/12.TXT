Unit 12	Welcome back to West High!

Twenty years later, two women are quite surprised at their 
high school reunion.

Marie: 		Our class pictures!

Kate: 		Remember Ted Green? He was so cute.

Marie: 		Yeah. And really athletic, too. Remember him out
		on the football field?

Kate: 		How could I forget? But I haven't seen him since 
		graduation. What was he planning to do?

Marie: 		I think he wanted to be an actor.

Kate: 		That's right. He went off to Los Angeles to
		drama school.

Marie: 		I would love to see him again. I hope he comes
		tonight.

Kate: 		Me, too. I wonder if he's married.

Marie: 		Yeah. Isn't this that guy from our geometry
		class? What was his name?

Kate: 		Yeah, the quiet one. Don something. He was easy
		to forget.

Marie: 		Don Porter, that was it. He hardly ever said a
		word.

Kate: 		He didn't go out much either. Poor guy. I don't
		think he ever had a date.

Marie: 		He always had his head in a book. What a
		bookworm!

Kate: 		Oh, look at this one.

Marie: 		That's Jenny Lindsay. She was always reading,
		too.

Kate: 		Weren't she and Don Porter friends?

Marie: 		Yeah, I think so. They were always talking about
		books.

Kate: 		And food! Remember how she loved to cook?

Marie: 		Oh, yeah.

Kate: 		Hey, look at that guy. He's really good-looking.

Marie: 		I think it's Ted Green. Shall we?

Kate: 		Of course. Excuse me. You're Ted Green, aren't
		you?

Don: 		Ted Green? No, I'm Don Porter.

Kate and Marie: Don Porter?

Don: 		Yeah. I think I was in the same geometry class
		with you two.

Kate: 		Yes, I think we were. It's really nice to see
		you, Don. Kate Davis. Remember?

Marie: 		Yeah, and I'm Marie Moore. You know, Kate and I
		were just talking about you.

Don: 		Really? Something good, I hope. Say, I'd like
		you both to meet my wife. Marie Moore, Kate
		Davis, my wife, Angela Lopez.

Angela: 	Hello.

Kate: 		Angela Lopez? You're that reporter from 
		Channel 4.

Angela: 	Yes, that's right.

Kate: 		Wow! Nice to meet you, Angela.

Marie: 		Yes. I'm glad you could come.

Angela: 	Thanks. Don and I thought it would be
		interesting, even though he didn't like high
		school very much.

Kate: 		You're kidding! I loved high school!

Marie: 		Oh, yeah. It was the best time of my life!

Kate: 		So, what have you been doing these days, Don?

Don: 		Well, lately I've been doing a little writing.

Angela: 	He's just being modest. His novel's on the
		best-seller list. Haven't you seen it?

Marie: 		You're that Don Porter?

Don: 		I guess I am. Hey, look who's here. . . . Jenny!
		How are you?

Jenny: 		Don, Angela. It's great to see you both again.
		When are you coming back to my restaurant?

Angela: 	Sometime next week, I hope. My parents are
		coming here for a visit, and I think they'd
		really enjoy your food.

Jenny: 		Well, that would be great.

Don: 		Kate, Marie, you remember Jenny Lindsay, don't
		you?

Kate: 		Of course. Although I hardly recognized you.

Marie: 		Hi, Jenny. Yeah, you've changed a lot.

Jenny: 		Yes, a lot has happened since high school. But 
		you two haven't changed a bit.

Marie: 		Thanks.

Kate: 		So, Jenny, you own a restaurant now?

Jenny: 		Yes, the Bistro, on Grand Avenue. You both
		should come by sometime.

Marie: 		You own the Bistro? I had no idea.

Kate: 		I've always wanted to have dinner there.

Marie: 		Yes. I hear it's quite an elegant place.

Kate: 		So, Jenny, how did you get into the restaurant
		business?

Jenny: 		Well, you remember how I used to love to cook.
		After I graduated from college, I went to
		culinary school. About four years ago, I decided
		to open my own place.

Don: 		And the food's fantastic!

Marie: 		That's wonderful.

Jenny: 		Thanks. But it's been hard work. And what about
		you two?

Kate: 		I'm between jobs at the moment. My last job
		didn't work out.

Marie: 		Well, my job's not very interesting. But I'd
		like to get into the travel business.

Jenny: 		Really? Well, I hope things go well for you
		both.

Marie: 		Thanks.

Kate: 		Who's that?

Marie: 		He looks familiar.

Kate: 		You know, you're right. It can't be.

Ted: 		Hi. Ted Green. Remember me?

Don: 		Ted! How are you? Don Porter.

Ted: 		Don, it's been a while.

Don: 		Yeah.

Ted: 		Jenny Lindsay. Hi.

Jenny: 		That's right. Hi, Ted.

Don: 		Ted, this is my wife, Angela.

Angela: 	Good to meet you, Ted.

Ted: 		Angela.

Jenny: 		And you remember Kate Davis and Marie Moore,
		don't you?

Ted: 		Sure. Hi.

Kate: 		Nice to see you, Ted.

Marie: 		Yes. You haven't changed a bit!
