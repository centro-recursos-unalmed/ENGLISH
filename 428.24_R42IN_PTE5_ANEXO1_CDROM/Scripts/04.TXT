Unit 4	What's Cooking?

A sports reporter hosts a cooking show when the chef gets sick.

Announcer: 	Live from Santa Clara, California. Welcome to
		"What's Cooking?" with your favorite chef,
		Louise Beaujolais.

		*	*	*

Louise: 	It must be something I ate. The oysters!

		*	*	*

Producer 1:	What are we going to do? The show is already on
		the air.

Producer 2:	What about Mark Spencer? I just saw him a minute
		ago.

Producer 1:	The sports reporter? Are you joking?

Producer 2:	Well, we have no choice. He's the only one here
		right now.

Producer 1:	Well, OK. I think we'll be sorry.

Mark: 		Oh, hi there. I'm Mark Spencer with "The Morning
		Sports Report." I'm afraid Louise Beaujola . . .
		Beaujolais . . . Louise Beaujolais isn't feeling
		well today, so I'm going to be your chef for the
		next half hour. So, what's today's recipe? 
		Hmm . . . it's a French dish called Fast Chicken
		with Oyster Dressing. This can't be too
		difficult, can it? So, let's get cooking! First,
		we need to turn on the oven. So I need an oven.
		This is the oven? This is the oven. We're making
		fast chicken, so we'll need a hot oven. There!
		Five hundred and fifty degrees Fahrenheit;
		that's two hundred and ninety degrees Celsius.
		That ought to be hot enough. Now, the chicken.
		Where's the chicken? Of course, in the
		refrigerator. "Next, thoroughly wash the
		chicken." Be sure you get the chicken nice and
		clean. Then pat the chicken dry. "Prepare
		stuffing." OK, now we make the oyster stuffing.
		"In a large frying pan, melt half a cup of
		butter." OK. "Next, cut up a large onion into
		small pieces and put it in the pan. Next, take
		three large oysters. Cut them up and add them to
		the pan. Add one-half cup mushroom caps." I like
		mushrooms. Let's put in a lot of these. "After
		the mushrooms, add one and a half cups of
		water." That's about right. There! And, oh, 
		"Mix in three cups bread crumbs." One. "Then add
		a pinch of salt." That can't be right. Probably
		needs more. "Now put the stuffing in the bird.
		Then close the bird." How am I supposed to close
		the bird? Ed, toss me that.

Producer 2:	This?

Mark: 		Yes, that.

Producer 2:	OK.

		*	*	*

Mark: 		"Now sprinkle with paprika . . . and add wine 
		to taste. Finally, put the chicken in the oven." 
		That wasn't so hard, was it? And doesn't it look
		good? Louise Beaujola . . . lais made a couple
		of these yesterday. Well, that's our show for
		today. Don't forget to watch "The Morning Sports
		Report" with me, Mark Spencer.

Announcer:	Tune in next week for another edition of "What's
		Cooking?" with Chef Louise Beaujolais. Until
		then:

Mark: 		Bon appetit!
