Unit 3	A great little apartment

Three college roommates look for a new apartment.

Cindy: 		Listen, I know this place is only four hundred 
		and fifty dollars a month, but I really think we 
		need to find a new apartment. It's just not big 
		enough for the three of use.

Karen: 		Well, it is pretty small, I agree, but the 
		location is great. We can walk to school.

Sue: 		And I love the neighborhood.

Cindy: 		Yeah, but this apartment is a shoe box!

Sue: 		Well, why don't we see what's in the paper? 
		Maybe we can find something a little bigger.

Cindy: 		Great idea! . . . Now, let's see what's
		available. Oh, here's something interesting. A
		two-bedroom apartment in Lakeview for only six
		hundred dollars. That's a great area.

Karen: 		Yeah, but a long way from school.

Sue: 		Six hundred dollars? That's pretty expensive, 
		isn't it?

Cindy: 		Hey, it's only a hundred and fifty dollars more 
		a month.

Karen: 		But who's going to share a bedroom?

Cindy: 		Oh, we can decide that later.

Sue: 		Well, let's take a look after class. We have 
		nothing to lose.

Cindy: 		Great idea.

Karen: 		Well, OK, I guess.

Cindy: 		This is the place - 1820 Lincoln Street. It 
		looks OK to me.

Karen: 		Let's wait and see. These places are never as
		good as they sound.

		*	*	*

Cindy: 		Hi. We're interested in looking at the apartment
		you've got for rent.

Manager: 	Oh, Apartment Number 1. Sure, sure. It's a great
		little apartment.

Sue: 		Little? How big is it?

Manager: 	Oh, well, it's plenty big enough for the three 
		of you. Are you students?

Karen: 		That's right. We're at the University of 
		Chicago.

Manager: 	University of Chicago, huh? That's a good 
		school. Well, let's go take a look, shall we?

		*	*	*

Manager: 	OK, it's right up here. . . . Well, this is the 
		living room.

Sue: 		Gee, it's kind of small. A little table and a 
		few chairs - that's about all that will fit in
		here.

Cindy: 		It looks big enough to me. And bigger than where 
		we are right now.

Karen: 		I guess it's OK. What's the kitchen like?

Manager:	Oh, well, take a look. It's right through here.

Sue: 		It sure could use a good cleaning.

Karen: 		That stove looks really dirty. Does it work?

Manager: 	I think so.

Karen: 		You mean you're not sure?

Manager: 	Don't worry about the stove. I'll take care of 
		it.

Cindy: 		Hey, I could really cook in here. It's so much 
		better than the kitchen we have now. We could
		have some good food for a change.

Sue: 		Hey, are you complaining about my cooking?

Cindy: 		Just kidding!

Manager: 	Let me show you the bedrooms. . . . Well, this 
		is the first bedroom. Plenty of room for two in
		here.

Karen: 		It's a bit noisy, but I guess that's OK. We're 
		not here very much during the day.

Cindy: 		It's fine if you keep the window closed.

Sue: 		Well, let's see the other bedroom.

Manager: 	Why, sure. It's right behind you over there.

Cindy: 		This seems fine. It's not as big as the other
		one, but there's room for my books and CDs.

Karen: 		Hey, who said you'd get the single room?

Cindy: 		Listen, I'm thinking of you. This way you won't
		have to listen to my snoring.

Manager: 	Well, what do you think?

Sue: 		Can we get back to you?

Manager: 	Oh, sure. But you'd better hurry. You know, 
		these apartments really go fast.

Karen: 		Thanks. We'll let you know.

		*	*	*

Sue: 		So, what do you think?

Cindy: 		I like it.

Karen: 		I don't know. With that freeway noise? What if
		we can't sleep?

Cindy: 		Hey, a little noise. No big deal.

Sue: 		I'm a little worried about the location. It's 
		going to take an hour to get to school from 
		here.

Cindy: 		Yeah, but we'll have a lot more room. I say 
		we take it!

Sue: 		You know, Karen, I think that whoever gets the
		single room really should pay more. That's only
		fair.

Karen: 		Not a bad idea, Sue. You and I are kind of short
		on money, and Cindy really wants a room of her
		own.

Cindy: 		What? Hey, wait a minute! Whoever said I wanted
		my own room?
