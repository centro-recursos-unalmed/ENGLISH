Unit 11	On the Santa Fe Trail

A man gives his two friends a tour of Santa Fe, New Mexico.

Lynne: 		Oh, here comes Pat.

Pat: 		Hi, guys.

Lynne: 		What perfect timing!

Pat: 		Hey, great to see you.

Bill: 		Good to see you, too.

Lynne: 		You know, Pat, we couldn't wait. We started to
		plan the trip the day you moved here.

Pat: 		I'm so glad you guys could come for a visit. I
		can't wait to show you around. Are you ready?

Bill: 		Sure. I've got my camera right here.

Lynne: 		Me, too.

Pat: 		Well, what are we waiting for? Come on.

		*	*	*

Pat: 		We might as well start at the Central Plaza, the
		oldest part of the city.

Lynne: 		What a beautiful place!

Pat: 		Yeah, it's one of my favorites. It was built by
		the Spanish soon after they arrived in 1610.

Bill: 		Wow! The Spanish were here a long time.

Pat: 		Yeah, that's true, but the Native Americans were
		living here long before the Spanish. In fact, 
		the Pueblo civilization around Santa Fe is more 
		than two thousand years old.

Bill: 		That's amazing!

Lynne: 		It's so peaceful and quiet.

Pat: 		Yeah. People come here to relax and take it easy
		and, you know, just hang out. But it's not 
		always like this. On the weekends, it gets 
		pretty crowded.

Lynne: 		Hey, Pat, what's that building over there?

Pat: 		Oh, that used to be the Palace of the Governors.
		It's a history museum now. And it's the oldest
		public building in the United States.

Bill: 		Sure looks old.

Pat: 		It is. It was built about the same time as the
		plaza. Hey, why don't we go inside and have a
		look?

Lynne: 		Great idea. Let's go.

Bill: 		Well, I really don't like museums.

Lynne: 		Oh, come on, Bill.

Pat: 		It's really very interesting. You'll enjoy it.

Bill: 		Well, OK.

		*	*	*

Bill: 		Well, this is all very interesting, but you 
		know, I'd like to take a look at some of the 
		handicrafts outside for sale.

Pat: 		Yeah, sure. Why not?

Lynne: 		It's OK with me.

Bill: 		Let's do it!

		*	*	*

Lynne: 		This is beautiful. What's it made of?

Merchant: 	Silver and turquoise.

Bill: 		How much is it?

Merchant: 	Sixty dollars. It's a great buy.

Bill: 		Sixty bucks! Are you joking? I'll give you 
		twenty dollars.

Merchant: 	I'm sorry, sir. I can't do that.

Bill: 		Twenty dollars. Come on.

Pat: 		Come on, Bill. We'll find something later.

Bill: 		I don't believe that. Sixty bucks!

Lynne: 		Thank you.

Pat: 		There's a lot more to see. . . . And now I'm 
		going to take you guys down the old 
		Santa Fe Trail.

Lynne: 		Oh, I've heard about the old Santa Fe Trail.

Pat: 		Yeah?

Lynne: 		Yeah.

Bill: 		Well, me, too, but what exactly is it?

Pat: 		Well, come on and I'll show you.

		*	*	*

Pat: 		The Santa Fe Trail is a very old road. During 
		the nineteenth century, people used it to 
		move west.

Lynne: 		Oh, look at those houses.

Pat: 		Oh, yeah. Those are adobe houses. They're 
		typical of this area.

Bill: 		What are they made of?

Pat: 		Believe it or not, they're made of mud.

Bill: 		Mud? Those houses are made of mud?

Pat: 		That's right. The style is Native American, but
		the Spanish adopted it when they came to 
		Santa Fe.

Lynne: 		What's that building over there?

Pat: 		That is the San Miguel Mission. It's one of the
		most famous buildings in Santa Fe. And as you 
		can see, it's also made of adobe. Oh, you see 
		those buildings over there? One of them is the 
		Museum of International Folk Art. They have 
		these great handmade items from all over the 
		world. Should we stop?

Lynne: 		Oh, yeah. I'd love to.

Bill: 		Actually, I'm kind of hungry.

Pat: 		Well, it is two o'clock. I'll bet you'rebot 
		hungry. Why don't we get something to eat first?

Bill: 		That's a great idea, Pat.

Lynne: 		Yeah, I can handle that.

Pat: 		How about some southwestern food?

Lynne: 		Oh, it sounds good to me. How about you, Bill?

Bill: 		Anything! I'm starving.

		*	*	*

Host: 		Enjoy your meal.

Pat: 		Thank you.

Lynne: 		Thanks. Thank you.

Pat: 		Sure.

Lynne: 		What a lovely place!

Pat: 		Yeah. Originally, it was a house. The guy that
		built it had a really large family - like 
		thirteen kids. And now it's a restaurant, and 
		they have the best southwestern food in town. 
		Have you tried southwestern food?

Lynne: 		Oh, yeah. I really love it.

Bill: 		No, but I am so hungry I'll eat anything.

Hostess: 	Would you like some hors d'oeuvres?

Pat: 		Oh, thanks. Here. Why don't you try some of 
		these while you're reading the menu?

Lynne: 		Great! Thanks.

Bill: 		Lynne, would you pass some of those, please?

Lynne: 		Sure, Bill. Santa Fe is such a beautiful place.
		You must really love living here, Pat.

Pat: 		I love it. Great scenery and all the history.

Bill: 		So many tourists, though. I really don't like
		tourists.

Pat: 		You know, you're a tourist, too, Bill.

Bill: 		But, yeah . . .

Pat: 		Hey, be careful of those!

Bill: 		Oh!

Lynne: 		What's the matter, Bill?

Pat: 		He just ate a hot pepper. Something tourists
		always do!
