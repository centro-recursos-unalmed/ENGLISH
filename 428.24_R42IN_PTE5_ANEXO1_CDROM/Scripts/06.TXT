Unit 6	Oh, I'm sorry!

An accident-prone man meets his match.

Jim: 		Would you mind closing the door, Mike?

Mike: 		Huh? Oh, sure, Jim. I'm sorry. Did I do that?

Jim: 		It's all right.

Mike: 		Well, here. Let me pick these up for you.

Jim: 		Don't bother. I'll get them later.

Mike: 		I'm sorry. I didn't see the wastebasket.

Jim: 		It's OK, Mike. I'll take care of it.

Mike: 		No, no, no. Let me.

Jim: 		Please be careful! My computer is plugged into
		the . . . Never mind.

Mike: 		I hope you weren't working on anything
		important.

Jim: 		What is it that you want?

Mike: 		I'm doing a survey on accidents in the
		workplace. Would you like to answer a few
		questions?

Jim: 		Look, I'm awfully busy right now, Mike. Could
		you come back a little later?

Mike: 		Oh, sure, Jim. What time would be good for you?

Jim: 		How about five-thirty?

Mike: 		Five-thirty. OK, I'll see you at five-thirty. 
		Wait a minute! Don't you usually go home at 
		. . . five o'clock?

Mike: 		Excuse me. My watch seems to have stopped. Could
		you tell me what time it is?

Elaine: 	Sure. It's exactly two thirty-five.

Mike: 		Oh, I'm sorry!

Elaine: 	Oh, no!

Mike: 		Here! Let me help you.

Elaine: 	Oh, that's all right. I'll get it.

Mike: 		I'm sorry. Are you OK?

Elaine: 	Sure. These things happen to me all the time.

Mike: 		They do?

Elaine: 	Uh-huh. I don't know why, but they always 
		do.

Mike: 		You know, I have the same problem.

Elaine: 	No kidding?

Mike: 		Yeah. In fact, I'm doing a survey on accidents 
		in the workplace.

Elaine: 	Really? That's fascinating!

Mike: 		I have it right here. Do you have time to answer
		a few questions?

Elaine: 	OK. By the way, my name's Elaine Nichols. What's
		yours?

Mike: 		Mike. Mike May. Nice to meet you.

Elaine: 	Sorry. See what I mean?

Mike: 		Hey, no problem.
