Unit 2	Wait for me!

Some tourists take a guided tour of Vancouver, British Columbia.

Ted: 		Wait for me! Wait, wait for me! Wait for me! 
		Hi. Good morning. Isn't it a beautiful day? 
		Sorry I'm late, everyone. I couldn't find my 
		guidebook.

Driver: 	Well, now that we're all here, we can begin. 

		*	*	*

Driver: 	Our first stop this morning will be Stanley
		Park. Stanley Park is one of the most beautiful
		places in Vancouver . . . 

Ted: 		Sorry. Did you say Stanley Park? I wonder where
		Stanley Park is. There must be a map in here
		somewhere.

Driver:		Stanley Park is right in the center of
		Vancouver. It's a popular place for people who
		live here and for visitors.

Ted: 		Oh, yes! It says here that it has a wonderful
		rose garden, a great aquarium, and a zoo for
		children.

Driver:		Uh, right. As I was saying, . . .

Ted: 		Say, do you know what time this tour ends? I'm
		taking a ride on the seaplane this afternoon,
		and I don't want to miss it.

Passenger 1:	I think it lasts about three hours.

Ted: 		Thanks. Oh, look at that!

		*	*	*

Driver: 	And here you can see our famous collection of 
		totem poles . . .

Ted: 		How old are these things anyway? I wonder who
		made them. Do you know where they come from? It
		seems like . . .

Driver: 	Yes. They're from the coast of British Columbia.
		As you can see, the styles are somewhat
		different. That's because . . .

Ted: 		Can you take my picture? I have to have a
		picture of myself next to the totem poles.

Passenger 2:	Well, I guess so.

		*	*	*

Ted: 		Hi!

Passenger 3:	Hi.

Ted: 		Wonderful day for sight-seeing, don't you think?

Passenger 3:	Yes, it is.

Ted: 		Well, I'm from Washington, D.C. Where are you
		from?

Passenger 3:	Montreal.

Ted: 		Oh, Montreal. They speak French in Montreal,
		don't they?

Passenger 3:	Yeah.

Ted: 		I speak a little French myself.

Passenger 3:	Really.

Ted: 		Bonjour! Comment-allez vous? Au revoir. Oh,
		French is such a beautiful language. I think
		everyone should learn to speak it, don't you?

		*	*	*

Driver: 	Our next stop will be a scenic overlook at
		Cypress Mountain. The view of the city is
		fantastic from up there.

Ted: 		Oh, Cypress Mountain. Sounds like a fantastic 
		place! I'm sure it's in my guidebook.

		*	*	*

Ted: 		Wow, what a fantastic view! Just look at that 
		city! I wonder what the population of Vancouver
		is. There must be a million people living down
		there.

Driver: 	Closer to two million - well, actually, one 
		million six hundred thousand.

Ted: 		Do you know how far we are from the hotel?

Passenger 4:	I'm sure the driver knows. Why don't you ask
		her?

Ted: 		How far are we from the hotel, driver? I may
		want to come back here again.

Driver: 	Well, not that far. About ten kilometers.

Passenger 1:	Say, you do ask a lot of questions, don't you?

Ted: 		Yeah, that's just me. I love learning about 
		things. Hmm . . . I bet I can get a great shot 
		from over there. Do you want to come with me?

Passenger 1:	No, thanks. I think I'll stay here and enjoy the 
		peace and quiet.

Ted: 		Hey, wait for me! Stop! Wait for me!
