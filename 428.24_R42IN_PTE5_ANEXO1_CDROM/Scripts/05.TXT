Unit 5	Did anyone see the tent?

A family goes on a camping trip in New Mexico.

John: 		Is all the food ready to go?

Debbie: 	Well, I've packed the drinks, the rolls, and 
		the hamburgers. Do we need anything else?

John: 		Oh, we'd better bring something for breakfast. 
		What about some eggs?

Debbie: 	Oh, sure.

John: 		Oh, and what about snacks? We ought to bring
		lots of fruit for the boys.

Debbie: 	Good idea. Have you packed all the camping gear?

John: 		Yeah, it's all packed . . . the tent, the
		sleeping bags. Uh-huh. Hey, this is going to be
		so much fun.

Debbie: 	Oh, yes. We haven't gone camping in years.

Ken: 		So, what should we take?

Henry: 		I'm going to take my guitar.

Ken: 		Great. And I'm going to take my cassette player.

Henry: 		You'd better take lots of music. We've got a 
		four-hour drive with just Mom and Dad.

Ken: 		Yeah. I don't know why they want to go camping
		anyway. Boring!

Henry: 		It sure is. And we're missing the baseball game
		on TV tonight.

Ken: 		Don't remind me. Hey, do you think I should take
		these?

Henry: 		Yeah. Why not?

		*	*	*

Henry: 		Gee, there's not much room. Maybe we should take
		some of this stuff out.

Ken: 		Yeah. What's this?

Henry: 		I don't know. It looks like an old laundry bag. 
		Put it in the garage. Then I'll have room for 
		this.

Debbie: 	OK. Everybody ready?

John: 		I think we're all set to go.

Henry and 
Ken: 		Ugh.

John: 		We'd better leave soon or we won't get a good 
		campsite.

		*	*	*

Debbie: 	I hope we didn't forget anything.

John: 		Well, I know we've got the food, the tent, and 
		the sleeping bags.

Debbie: 	And I've got traveler's checks and credit cards 
		in my wallet, just in case. So what's the first 
		thing you're going to do when we get there?

Henry: 		Lie in the sun and sleep.

Ken: 		I'm going to listen to music.

John: 		But we're going camping, boys. We're supposed to
		go fishing and climbing.

Henry: 		Yeah, right!

		*	*	*

Debbie: 	Did anyone see the tent?

John: 		I put it in the van this morning.

Henry: 		What did it look like?

Debbie: 	It's in a green bag.

Ken: 		Uh-oh! Is that what it was?

John: 		What do you mean?

Henry: 		We didn't realize it was the tent. We thought 
		it was . . .

Ken: 		An old laundry bag or something. So we took it 
		out to make room for our things.

Debbie: 	Are you serious? What are we going to do now?

John: 		I don't know. We can't camp out here without a
		tent.

Henry: 		I have an idea. We passed a motel a couple miles
		back.

Ken: 		Yeah, it even had a swimming pool! Why don't we
		stay there? That would be fun.

Henry: 		I bet they even have a video game room, too.

Ken: 		Yeah, we can watch the baseball game on TV, too.

Henry: 		This is going to be great! Yes!

Ken: 		Yes!
