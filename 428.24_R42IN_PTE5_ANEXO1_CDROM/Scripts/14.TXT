Unit  14	Ms. Gardner's promotion

Ms. Gardner gets a promotion and a pleasant surprise.

Steve: 		Wow! Look at that. Julia finally got her
		promotion.

Ruth: 		Gee, what a surprise!

Jerry: 		She must be excited about it. That probably
		means she'll move to the head office.

Steve: 		Here she comes now. Time to get back to work!

Ms. Gardner: 	(to herself) How strange.

		*	*	*

Ms. Gardner: 	Barbara . . .

Barbara: 	Yes?

Ms. Gardner: 	Can I ask you something?

Barbara: 	Sure.

Ms. Gardner: 	This may sound crazy, but . . . I wonder if
		people are upset by my promotion.

Barbara: 	No, I'm sure everyone's happy for you.

Ms. Gardner: 	It's just that . . . well, no one has said
		anything to me, and . . . sometimes I see people
		whispering.

Barbara: 	It probably means they're worried that things
		might change around here. You know how people
		hate change.

Ms. Gardner:  	Maybe you're right. . . . So, how's your new
		assistant working out?

Barbara: 	She seems to be doing fine. She's a quick
		learner.

Ms. Gardner: 	What's her name again?

Barbara: 	Laurie. Laurie Baxter.

Barbara: 	So, Laurie, how are things going?

Laurie: 	Fine. I've been busy all morning.

Barbara: 	Have you taken a break yet? 

Laurie: 	No.

Barbara: 	You know, you are allowed to take a
		fifteen-minute break in the morning and one in
		the afternoon.

Laurie: 	Oh. OK.

Ms. Gardner: 	Excuse me. Barbara, can you have lunch with me
		today? I wanted to review some files with you.

Barbara: 	Well, . . . actually, I've already made plans
		for lunch.

Ms. Gardner: 	Oh, I see. Well, . . . 

Barbara: 	Sorry about that. Maybe we can meet later this
		afternoon.

Ms. Gardner: 	Yes, that will be fine. We'll do the work after
		lunch then.

Barbara: 	Right. I'll be back by one o'clock.

Ms. Gardner: 	All right.

		*	*	*

Ms. Gardner: 	Barbara, could you come into my office, please? 
		I'm ready to begin.

Laurie: 	Barbara's away from her desk. Is there anything
		I can do for you?

Ms. Gardner: 	No, thank you, Laurie. Just have her see me as
		soon as she gets back.

Laurie: 	Well, she might be gone a little longer than
		usual.

Ms. Gardner: 	Oh? What do you mean?

Laurie: 	Uh . . . she said she had a toothache. I think
		she went to see the dentist.

Ms. Gardner: 	Well, OK. Just send her in when she gets back. 
		(to herself) That's strange. Barbara usually
		tells me when she has an appointment. 

		*	*	*

Ms Gardner: 	Where is everyone? . . . What's going on,
		Laurie?

Laurie: 	Oh, nothing. I think someone's having a little
		birthday party in the conference room.

Ms. Gardner: 	A birthday party? Well, that's ridiculous.  The
		office staff isn't allowed to hold birthday
		parties in the conference room.

Laurie: 	Uh . . . wait! I mean, I'm sure it's not what
		you think . . . I'm sure it's only . . . oh,
		boy.

		*	*	*

Ms. Gardner: 	What is going on in here?

Barbara: 	Oh, no! You weren't supposed to come in yet, but
		since you're here . . . Congratulations on your
		promotion!

Ms. Gardner: 	Thank you!
