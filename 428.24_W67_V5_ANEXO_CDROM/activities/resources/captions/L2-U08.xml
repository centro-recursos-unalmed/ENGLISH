	<p begin="00:00:04.00" dur="00:00:04.80">Elephants are very large, but they are gentle and intelligent animals.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:09.10" dur="00:00:02.50">They are important to humans too.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:12.00" dur="00:00:04.35">Elephants and people have worked together for over 2,000 years.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:16.35" dur="00:00:03.55">But when they work with people, the elephants are not in the wild.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:20.31" dur="00:00:04.00">They are usually in captivity and in zoos or circuses.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:24.35" dur="00:00:04.00">Over time, people have learned a lot about the way elephants act.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:28.50" dur="00:00:03.20">However, there is one question that people are still asking:</p>
	<p begin="00:00:32.10" dur="00:00:03.20">How can people keep elephants happy in captivity?</p>
	<p begin="00:00:35.30" dur="00:00:02.75">"OK, everyone, trunk foot salute.  Angus.  Trunk foot."</p>
	<p begin="00:00:38.22" dur="00:00:04.17">Mike Hackenberger is an animal trainer at the Baltimore Zoo.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:42.45" dur="00:00:03.00">His elephants are very healthy and seem to be happy.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:45.47" dur="00:00:05.20">“We make sure teeth are where they’re supposed to be, we don’t have over ingrown feet...this is all that good husbandry stuff."</p>
	<p begin="00:00:51.07" dur="00:00:02.00">He even talks to his elephants.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:53.21" dur="00:00:03.10">"Oh you’re happy...hear that?  That’s a happy sound."</p>
	<p begin="00:00:56.31" dur="00:00:01.00">"That’s a good sound.”</p>
	<p begin="00:00:57.35" dur="00:00:02.50">But can elephants be happy?</p>
	<p begin="00:01:01.30" dur="00:00:02.53">Do animals have feelings?</p>
	<p begin="00:01:04.28" dur="00:00:04.00">If so, are their feelings the same as people's feelings?</p>
	<p begin="00:01:09.35" dur="00:00:02.77">There's a big discussion about this subject.</p>
	<p begin="00:01:12.40" dur="00:00:03.10">"Everything's going to be all right."</p>
	<p begin="00:01:16.20" dur="00:00:05.00">Many people who work closely with animals say that they do have feelings</p>
	<p begin="00:01:20.20" dur="00:00:02.00">and can experience happiness.</p>
	<p begin="00:01:22.50" dur="00:00:02.00">Other people are not certain.</p>
	<p begin="00:01:25.60" dur="00:00:10.80">There’s one thing that everyone agrees on - elephants seem happier—and safer—if their home in the zoo or circus is very similar to life in the wild.  </p>
	<p begin="00:01:37.00" dur="00:00:04.20">Hackenberger's talk with the elephants may even help comfort them.</p>
	<p begin="00:01:41.28" dur="00:00:03.30">“Head over, let’s go kids."</p>
	<p begin="00:01:44.05" dur="00:00:08.00">"Let’s go, Fatman...move up...here to me...watch yourself...here to me!"</p>
	<p begin="00:01:52.05" dur="00:00:05.00">"We’re walking, guys. Come on, Funnyface! Good boy!”</p>
	<p begin="00:01:57.11" dur="00:00:04.00">According to Hackenberger, elephant training has improved in recent years.</p>
	<p begin="00:02:01.28" dur="00:00:05.40">“I’ll tell you that...um...ten, fifteen, twenty years ago, some of the techniques were a bit barbaric."</p>
	<p begin="00:02:07.20" dur="00:00:03.80">"We’ve walked away from that, but society’s walked away from it.”</p>
	<p begin="00:02:11.02" dur="00:00:01.65">Elephants are social animals.</p>
	<p begin="00:02:13.22" dur="00:00:04.54">That means that they live in families and herds and they need other elephants.</p>
	<p begin="00:02:18.00" dur="00:00:04.20">If they are alone for a long time, elephants can start to act in an unusual way.</p>
	<p begin="00:02:22.40" dur="00:00:03.40">Hackenberger talks about one elephant, called Limba; </p>
	<p begin="00:02:26.39" dur="00:00:03.80">Limba was alone for 30 years in a zoo in northern Quebec.</p>
	<p begin="00:02:30.30" dur="00:00:02.00">She didn't do well by herself.</p>
	<p begin="00:02:32.42" dur="00:00:04.00">Hackenberger then tells how two other elephants came to live with Limba</p>
	<p begin="00:02:36.42" dur="00:00:02.54">when they were only two days old.</p>
	<p begin="00:02:38.97" dur="00:00:03.00">Limba 'fell in love' with the two young elephants, he explains,</p>
	<p begin="00:02:42.42" dur="00:00:03.10">and that's why she became a happier, and more normal elephant.</p>
	<p begin="00:02:46.05" dur="00:00:05.00">When he's training elephants, Hackenberger lets them do the things they do in the wild.</p>
	<p begin="00:02:51.10" dur="00:00:02.30">And there's one thing elephants love...</p>
	<p begin="00:02:54.20" dur="00:00:04.00">“Do you want to go swimming? Do you? Do you? Do you want to go swimming?"</p>
	<p begin="00:02:58.25" dur="00:00:01.20">"I think that’s a yes!"</p>
	<p begin="00:02:59.45" dur="00:00:01.20"> "Absolutely! Let’s get in the water.”</p>
	<p begin="00:03:01.10" dur="00:00:02.45">So what is the answer to the question:</p>
	<p begin="00:03:03.70" dur="00:00:03.30">How can people keep elephants happy in captivity?</p>
	<p begin="00:03:07.20" dur="00:00:04.10">Hackenberger believes that elephants need to learn how to be elephants,</p>
	<p begin="00:03:11.31" dur="00:00:01.50">just as they are in the wild.</p>
	<p begin="00:03:13.20" dur="00:00:01.00">"It doesn't get better."</p>
	<p begin="00:03:14.20" dur="00:00:01.05">"No it doesn't."</p>
	<p begin="00:03:15.28" dur="00:00:01.40">"Are they trained?"</p>
	<p begin="00:03:16.70" dur="00:00:01.00">"I think so."</p>
	<p begin="00:03:17.80" dur="00:00:01.50">"They're trained to be elephants!"</p>
	<p begin="00:03:19.40" dur="00:00:01.40">"Just be an elephant!"</p>
	<p begin="00:03:21.00" dur="00:00:04.20">It certainly seems these animals are some very happy elephants!</p>
