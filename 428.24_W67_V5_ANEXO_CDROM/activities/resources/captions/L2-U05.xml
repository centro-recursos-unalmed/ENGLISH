<p begin="00:00:03.00" dur="00:00:03.50">It's September in the Congo...just north of the equator.</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.60" dur="00:00:03.00">An expedition unlike any other is beginning.</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.93" dur="00:00:04.00">A team of scientists and researchers is traveling almost 2,000 kilometers...</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.09" dur="00:00:04.50">through a rainforest that covers over 150,000 square kilometers!</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.06" dur="00:00:04.95">Their aim is to make a scientific record of a world which could be disappearing from Earth...</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.95" dur="00:00:01.50">the Congo Basin.</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.83" dur="00:00:04.00">Dr. Michael Fay is a scientist from the Wildlife Conservation Society.</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.89" dur="00:00:04.90">He's leading the expedition he calls 'The Megatransect,' or 'the big crossing.'</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.88" dur="00:00:03.20">According to Fay, if they don't document the wildlife here now,</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.10" dur="00:00:02.50">there may never be another chance to do it!</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.89" dur="00:00:05.00">"What I'm trying to do, in a desperate way, is to show the world...</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.03" dur="00:00:06.50">that we're just about to lose the last little gem in the African continent."</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.69" dur="00:00:02.20">"And if we don't do something now...</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.95" dur="00:00:04.70">if we don't do it today, we can forget about it."</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.94" dur="00:00:03.50">The Congo Basin contains almost one quarter of the world's rain forests.</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.93" dur="00:00:05.80">It may have up to half of all of the wild plants and animals found in all of Africa.</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.80" dur="00:00:05.00">Fay's plan is to collect and record data on almost every part of the rain forest.</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.95" dur="00:00:04.00">He wants to document the trees, the plants, and the animals that he sees there.</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.00" dur="00:00:02.80">It's a job that's going to take time...</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.82" dur="00:00:03.40">After eight months of traveling, the team is now in Gabon.</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.30" dur="00:00:08.10">Their next challenge is to reach a group of strange hills that are made of stone and which rise far above the forest floor.</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.88" dur="00:00:03.20">At last, the men reach the hills and begin to walk up.</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.15" dur="00:00:04.20">Suddenly, they realize that they're finally above the tops of the trees.</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.96" dur="00:00:02.80">"We can see a long way here, you know...</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.81" dur="00:00:05.00">70 or 80 kilometers in every direction. We can see 360 degrees around."</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.30" dur="00:00:02.00">"There are no humans."</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.50" dur="00:00:03.60">"There's not a single village, there's not a single road..."</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.97" dur="00:00:02.30">"It's an amazing place."</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.82" dur="00:00:04.50">The team continues. They can hear their next challenge before they reach it.</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.35" dur="00:00:01.00">Rapids!</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.02" dur="00:00:02.00">"Okay, wow!"</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.89" dur="00:00:02.05">The Kongou Chutes are an important part</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.95" dur="00:00:03.00">of the landscape that the team wants to protect.</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.97" dur="00:00:04.50">This land of fast water and old forests is in danger because of logging.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.20" dur="00:00:03.00">Right now, the team has a more immediate problem.</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.40" dur="00:00:02.60">They must cross the dangerous river here.</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.20" dur="00:00:03.90">It's only a few hundred meters wide, but the team must use guide ropes,</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.15" dur="00:00:04.00">stepping stones, and everything they know to get across.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.81" dur="00:00:04.80">It takes a full day...and there's still a long way to go!</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.97" dur="00:00:04.50">After more than a year, the team finally reaches the end of their travels.</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.91" dur="00:00:06.75">"We'd been walking in the woods in our own little world for fifteen months and now it was over."</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.80" dur="00:00:01.80">"I was overwhelmed."</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.65" dur="00:00:04.40">Dr. Fay's expedition walked through some of the wildest lands of Africa.</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.10" dur="00:00:03.40">They documented as many of the things they found as possible.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.60" dur="00:00:04.30">And they did it all in an attempt to save a disappearing world.</p>
