	<p begin="00:00:03.20" dur="00:00:01.00">Orangutans.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:04.20" dur="00:00:04.20">These highly developed primates come from Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:08.50" dur="00:00:05.00">They are so much like humans that their name actually means 'person of the forest' in Malay.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:13.85" dur="00:00:02.00">They can even communicate through language.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:16.30" dur="00:00:02.50">And at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C.,</p>
	<p begin="00:00:18.85" dur="00:00:04.50">two orangutans named Inda and Azie are showing the world just how well they can do it.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:23.50" dur="00:00:03.60">Rob Shumaker is the coordinator of the Orangutan Language Project.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:27.30" dur="00:00:05.00">"We are really adding to what we understand about orangutan mental ability."</p>
	<p begin="00:00:33.00" dur="00:00:05.00">"I also think that we’re doing something very, very good for these individual orangutans."</p>
	<p begin="00:00:38.40" dur="00:00:06.00">Shumaker believes that orangutans and other apes in captivity need a stimulating physical and mental environment.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:44.70" dur="00:00:05.30">The zoo allows its orangutans to move around freely and gives them choices on where to go.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:50.05" dur="00:00:03.50">Even Shumaker's language program is voluntary for them.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:53.60" dur="00:00:06.59">"It gives the orangutans some choice and some agency about what they do day to day."</p>
	<p begin="00:00:60.20" dur="00:00:05.30">"And I think that’s incredibly important for a species that has this much going on mentally."</p>
	<p begin="00:00:66.00" dur="00:00:02.00">"She’s just naming the object. Good girl!"</p>
	<p begin="00:01:09.00" dur="00:00:04.10">Shumaker works daily with the orangutans in the program to develop their language skills.</p>
	<p begin="00:01:13.20" dur="00:00:04.20">Today he’s working with Inda, a 20-year-old female orangutan.</p>
	<p begin="00:01:17.45" dur="00:00:06.50">Inda is learning a vocabulary of symbols that she connects with objects, such as bananas, apples, and cups.</p>
	<p begin="00:01:24.50" dur="00:00:06.70">Every day, visitors watch as Shumaker and Inda perform certain exercises on the computer to test what language she knows.</p>
	<p begin="00:01:32.50" dur="00:00:03.30">But even apes have to wait for slow computers!</p>
	<p begin="00:01:35.85" dur="00:00:01.70">“Oh, hold on."</p>
	<p begin="00:01:37.60" dur="00:00:05.00">"The computer's not responding quickly enough, but she's doing it correctly. Try again."</p>
	<p begin="00:01:43.00" dur="00:00:08.15">Inda can identify food and objects using symbols, as well as put symbols together to form simple sentences with a verb and an object.</p>
	<p begin="00:01:51.20" dur="00:00:05.80">Basically, she can use the symbols to get her point across, which is the essential purpose of language.</p>
	<p begin="00:01:57.25" dur="00:00:06.00">"Each one learns their own way. Each one has their own types of questions that they are better or worse at."</p>
	<p begin="00:01:63.50" dur="00:00:10.00">"And the big emphasis is they are individuals, and their progress is not the same as the other orangutans just because it’s orangutan."</p>
	<p begin="00:02:13.65" dur="00:00:03.55">For example, Inda’s brother Azie is not as social as his sister.</p>
	<p begin="00:02:17.25" dur="00:00:05.50">At first, Shumaker thought that Azie was not as intelligent, but that’s not true at all.</p>
	<p begin="00:02:22.76" dur="00:00:06.50">In fact, Azie is very intelligent; he just isn’t always as interested in communicating as his sister is.</p>
	<p begin="00:02:30.00" dur="00:00:05.00">The Orangutan Language Project is part of an exhibit at the National Zoo called 'Think Tank.'</p>
	<p begin="00:02:35.10" dur="00:00:05.40">The exhibit explores the process of thinking, and actually involves visitors to the zoo in the program.</p>
	<p begin="00:02:40.50" dur="00:00:08.00">"What's really nice about Think Tank is that it brings a lot of the behind the scenes activities and research that involve animals</p>
	<p begin="00:02:49.00" dur="00:00:04.00">right up front where it should be, where people are going to see it."</p>
	<p begin="00:02:53.70" dur="00:00:6.10">Zoo officials hope that exhibits like Think Tank will educate the public and increase conservation efforts.</p>
	<p begin="00:02:60.50" dur="00:00:05.00">Orangutans could become extinct in the wild in the next 10 to 12 years.</p>
	<p begin="00:03:06.25" dur="00:00:04.30">"Give people a chance to know more about what's going on mentally for orangutans."</p>
	<p begin="00:03:10.55" dur="00:00:03.35">"I know that that increases their regard for them."</p>
	<p begin="00:03:17.00" dur="00:00:04.00">Shumaker personally developed the symbols for the orangutans' vocabulary,</p>
	<p begin="00:03:21.00" dur="00:00:04.00">but he says that the project has really been successful because of Inda and Azie.</p>
	<p begin="00:03:25.10" dur="00:00:07.00">"I think of this language project as really a team effort between me, and Inda, and Azie. And we all work together on this."</p>
	<p begin="00:03:32.15" dur="00:00:05.30">"This is not my project; it's our project. And I want them to voluntarily participate."</p>
	<p begin="00:03:37.55" dur="00:00:07.10">"When they do that, I know that they're doing it because they enjoy it, and they like it, and they want to be involved with it."</p>
	<p begin="00:03:45.20" dur="00:00:01.10">"And that's important."</p>
	<p begin="00:03:46.50" dur="00:00:02.40">It’s easy to see that Shumaker has been successful.</p>
	<p begin="00:03:49.30" dur="00:00:05.50">The orangutan language team of Inda, Azie, and Shumaker certainly enjoy their work!</p>
