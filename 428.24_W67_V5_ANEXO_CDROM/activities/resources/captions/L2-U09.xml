	<p begin="00:00:02.50" dur="00:00:04.10">Christopher Columbus was born in Italy, in 1451.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:07.00" dur="00:00:06.50">At that time, educated Europeans realized that the earth wasn’t flat as some people thought. </p>
	<p begin="00:00:13.60" dur="00:00:02.00">They knew that it was round.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:16.20" dur="00:00:05.00">When Columbus was a young man, he decided to study geography and go to sea.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:21.40" dur="00:00:03.50">Columbus wanted to find the answer to a major problem.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:25.30" dur="00:00:03.00">Europeans wanted spices from India and China.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:28.30" dur="00:00:06.50">However, it cost too much money to carry these products from the East using the traditional land and sea routes.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:35.40" dur="00:00:04.00">Columbus wanted to find a new sea route from Europe to Asia.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:39.60" dur="00:00:02.20">He now knew that the earth was round.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:42.20" dur="00:00:04.10">Because of this, Columbus thought he could reach the east, by sailing west.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:46.30" dur="00:00:03.30">However, he needed a lot of money to find out if he was right.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:50.00" dur="00:00:08.00">In 1492, Columbus persuaded King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain to give him money for the voyage.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:58.00" dur="00:00:03.00">He received enough money for three small ships:</p>
	<p begin="00:00:61.00" dur="00:00:02.80">the Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Maria.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:64.38" dur="00:00:04.40">Columbus then sailed west, but he didn't know what was waiting for him...</p>
	<p begin="00:00:69.20" dur="00:00:06.50">On October 9, after a month at sea, the sailors were very tired of looking for land.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:75.75" dur="00:00:01.75">They wanted to go back.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:77.52" dur="00:00:02.00">Finally, Columbus agreed.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:80.00" dur="00:00:03.00">He said that they would look for land for three more days.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:83.15" dur="00:00:03.20">If there was still no land, they would go back to Europe.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:86.53" dur="00:00:06.07">Then, on October 12, 1492, just three days later, a sailor on the Pinta cried out.</p>
	<p begin="00:01:33.14" dur="00:00:02.00">He could see land!</p>
	<p begin="00:01:35.46" dur="00:00:05.00">It was a small island in the Bahamas, probably the island known today as San Salvador. </p>
	<p begin="00:01:40.63" dur="00:00:04.40">Columbus and his sailors got into a small boat and went to the island.</p>
	<p begin="00:01:45.60" dur="00:00:04.70">There, they walked onto the land that would one day be called 'the Americas.'</p>
	<p begin="00:00:111.11" dur="00:00:03.00">Columbus didn't know he was on a new continent.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:114.81" dur="00:00:04.00">He thought he was near the coast of Asia, in the islands of the East Indies.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:118.85" dur="00:00:04.10">He even called the people who came to meet him 'Indians.'</p>
	<p begin="00:02:02.96" dur="00:00:05.50">Because of this, people incorrectly called Native Americans ‘Indians’ for hundreds of years.</p>
	<p begin="00:02:09.00" dur="00:00:02.00">Columbus returned to Spain.</p>
	<p begin="00:02:11.05" dur="00:00:05.60">He brought gold, parrots, and other things from the new world to show the king and queen.</p>
	<p begin="00:02:17.00" dur="00:00:04.20">For him, this was the high point of his life as a sailor.</p>
	<p begin="00:02:21.23" dur="00:00:02.70">Columbus made three more voyages to the new world.</p>
	<p begin="00:02:24.00" dur="00:00:03.00">But in the end, he didn't achieve what he wanted.</p>
	<p begin="00:02:27.00" dur="00:00:04.80">He didn't find a new route to bring spices from Asia to Europe.</p>
	<p begin="00:02:32.00" dur="00:00:05.60">Columbus was a disappointed man when he died on May 20, 1506.</p>
	<p begin="00:02:38.50" dur="00:00:03.80">Today there are still many concerns about Columbus' voyage.</p>
	<p begin="00:02:42.40" dur="00:00:05.40">For hundreds of years, people believed Columbus was the first European to reach America. </p>
	<p begin="00:02:48.45" dur="00:00:05.80">We now know that the Vikings reached North America five hundred years earlier than Columbus.</p>
	<p begin="00:02:54.40" dur="00:00:04.40">It's also true that Columbus found a new world for Europeans to explore.</p>
	<p begin="00:02:58.90" dur="00:00:05.00">But in the end, this exploration caused many problems for Native Americans.</p>
	<p begin="00:03:03.95" dur="00:00:05.00">Columbus made 1492 one of the most important years in world history-</p>
	<p begin="00:03:09.00" dur="00:00:03.80">important for both good and bad reasons.</p>
	<p begin="00:03:13.00" dur="00:00:01.80">However, one thing is certain:</p>
	<p begin="00:03:15.00" dur="00:00:06.50">on October 12, 1492, the new world — and the old — changed for all time.</p>
