<p begin="00:00:01.70" dur="00:00:02.70">Camogli is a town on the Italian coast. </p>
<p begin="00:00:04.95" dur="00:00:03.20">The sun shines on the houses next to the sea. </p>
<p begin="00:00:08.15" dur="00:00:02.30">But this town is different. </p>
<p begin="00:00:12.80" dur="00:00:02.50">In the town of Camogli, things look real...</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.70" dur="00:00:01.50">but they’re not. </p>
<p begin="00:00:20.00" dur="00:00:03.45">This fishing village near Genoa is full of trompe l'oeil —</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.80" dur="00:00:01.30">a special art. </p>
<p begin="00:00:26.80" dur="00:00:02.50">In trompe l'oeil, things are not real.</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.50" dur="00:00:02.40">In this village, windows open - </p>
<p begin="00:00:31.90" dur="00:00:01.50">in solid walls.</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.00" dur="00:00:02.50">Beautiful stonework is paint!</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.90" dur="00:00:02.30">And the flowers are not real.</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.25" dur="00:00:02.20">They are painted on the buildings! </p>
<p begin="00:00:43.10" dur="00:00:05.90">In the past, Camogli’s fishermen painted their houses in bright colors and unusual designs. </p>
<p begin="00:00:49.10" dur="00:00:03.10">The fishermen wanted to see their homes from the water.  </p>
<p begin="00:00:53.00" dur="00:00:06.90">Then, in the 1700s, this art made small, simple buildings look special and expensive.</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.00" dur="00:00:03.10">There are thousands of trompe l'oeil houses in this area. </p>
<p begin="00:01:03.15" dur="00:00:02.40">But only a few artists paint them.</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.20" dur="00:00:02.70">Raffaella Stracca is an artist. </p>
<p begin="00:01:09.40" dur="00:00:03.60">Raffaella uses old and new methods in her work.</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.60" dur="00:00:04.80">"You find a lot of these painted facades in the area of Liguria a lot."</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.80" dur="00:00:03.10">It is difficult to be a good trompe l’oeil painter.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.00" dur="00:00:04.40">Rafaella has worked for 20 years to paint stone so it looks real. </p>
<p begin="00:01:34.40" dur="00:00:01.90">Carlo Pere is an artist. </p>
<p begin="00:01:36.35" dur="00:00:04.70">He paints trompe l’oeil for people who live in small houses or city apartments. </p>
<p begin="00:01:42.10" dur="00:00:03.40">They want Pere’s trompe l’oeil terraces and balconies. </p>
<p begin="00:01:45.60" dur="00:00:02.70">Carlo feels that trompe l’oeil is special. </p>
<p begin="00:01:52.70" dur="00:00:05.20">"Trompe l'oeil means bringing the central city of Milan to the sea, or the sea to the mountains...</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.90" dur="00:00:02.00">or even the mountains to the sea."</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.10" dur="00:00:04.10">Carlo uses an art book from the 1300s to study trompe l’oeil.</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.40" dur="00:00:02.40">He uses traditional-style paints.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.10" dur="00:00:02.90">He wants to protect the trompe l’oeil traditions.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.90" dur="00:00:04.30">In this part of Italy, you can still see the local culture everywhere.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.30" dur="00:00:04.30">It’s in the street, in the bay, and in the cafés of the town.</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.30" dur="00:00:03.70">But in Camogli what you see is not always real.</p>
