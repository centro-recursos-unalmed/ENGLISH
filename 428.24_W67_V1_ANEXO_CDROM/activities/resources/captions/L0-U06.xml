<p begin="00:00:03.00" dur="00:00:05.50">In a region of Ethiopia, hot lava erupts from the Erta Ale volcano. </p>
<p begin="00:00:11.00" dur="00:00:06.00">The temperature of this lava is more than 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit.  </p>
<p begin="00:00:17.10" dur="00:00:04.00">Now, a team of explorers wants to see Erta Ale. </p>
<p begin="00:00:21.10" dur="00:00:03.00">They want to learn about the volcano. </p>
<p begin="00:00:24.10" dur="00:00:02.80">It’s a difficult trek, and the team has to use camels.</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.50" dur="00:00:01.30">They reach the crater. </p>
<p begin="00:00:29.40" dur="00:00:05.50">Franck Tessier and Irene Margaritis are geologists and professors at the University of Nice. </p>
<p begin="00:00:36.80" dur="00:00:02.80">They travel very far to see Erta Ale.</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.70" dur="00:00:03.10">In the crater, they see the black lava lake. </p>
<p begin="00:00:45.20" dur="00:00:02.60">"It is quite exciting. I want to see it now."</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.60" dur="00:00:04.00">Erta Ale is in the Afar area of Ethiopia. </p>
<p begin="00:00:53.50" dur="00:00:04.00">The Afar triangle is in an area where three continental plates meet.</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.20" dur="00:00:01.40">These plates move every year.</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.00" dur="00:00:04.00">The Erta Ale volcano has the oldest lava lake in the world. </p>
<p begin="00:01:04.00" dur="00:00:02.65">The lake is one of the lowest points on Earth.</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.70" dur="00:00:05.30">At Erta Ale, geologists study how the world started millions of years ago. </p>
<p begin="00:01:13.10" dur="00:00:03.00">Red hot lava comes out from the earth. </p>
<p begin="00:01:16.30" dur="00:00:03.10">This lava forms Erta Ale’s lava lake. </p>
<p begin="00:01:20.20" dur="00:00:03.30">When the lava cools, it is hard and black. </p>
<p begin="00:01:25.40" dur="00:00:03.30">Hot magma breaks through when the volcano erupts.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.00" dur="00:00:05.10">The geologists stand at the top of the active volcano and wait next to the crater. </p>
<p begin="00:01:36.60" dur="00:00:04.10">It’s difficult to be there; there is a strong smell of sulfur.</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.50" dur="00:00:01.80">It’s very, very hot.</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.80" dur="00:00:02.70">Then, the group goes down into the crater. </p>
<p begin="00:01:46.60" dur="00:00:04.00">Professor Tessier wants to collect pieces of the red-hot lava.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.30" dur="00:00:02.30">It’s 2:00 in the morning when they return. </p>
<p begin="00:01:54.00" dur="00:00:03.80">They’re very tired and, Professor Margaritis says; </p>
<p begin="00:01:57.90" dur="00:00:01.30">"very hot," </p>
<p begin="00:02:01.30" dur="00:00:01.70">"I think this is fresh lava,"</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.40" dur="00:00:05.70">The pieces don’t come directly from the lava lake. However, the team decides they’re fresh.  </p>
<p begin="00:02:10.02" dur="00:00:03.50">The team goes back to analyze the pieces of lava.</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.40" dur="00:00:02.85">They want to learn new information to teach to others. </p>
<p begin="00:02:19.40" dur="00:00:06.80">They want to know what the lava of Erta Ale can teach them about how the world started millions of years ago. </p>
