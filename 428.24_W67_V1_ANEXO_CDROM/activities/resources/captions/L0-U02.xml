<p begin="00:00:05.20" dur="00:00:05.80">Einar and his sister Andrea are from Heimaey, in Iceland, a small country in Europe.</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.10" dur="00:00:02.80">They have a very interesting job. </p>
<p begin="00:00:14.30" dur="00:00:01.70">They have a box. </p>
<p begin="00:00:16.10" dur="00:00:03.50">In their box they have two young puffins, or pufflings.  </p>
<p begin="00:00:21.25" dur="00:00:02.45">Einar and Andrea help these birds. </p>
<p begin="00:00:23.95" dur="00:00:01.50">They want to rescue them.</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.83" dur="00:00:07.70">"They don’t survive if they stay in the town. Cats and dogs eat them, or they just die."</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.54" dur="00:00:01.90">"It’s really good to save them."</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.00" dur="00:00:04.00">The children of Heimaey rescue young puffins, or pufflings. </p>
<p begin="00:00:47.50" dur="00:00:03.40">Every summer, they help pufflings get to the sea. </p>
<p begin="00:00:51.00" dur="00:00:01.50">It is their job.</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.03" dur="00:00:01.70">"You have to save the birds."</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.54" dur="00:00:02.70">"If they don’t do it, they die."</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.95" dur="00:00:02.30">"They find it very exciting."</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.94" dur="00:00:02.60">They take the lost pufflings to the beach.  </p>
<p begin="00:01:05.85" dur="00:00:02.60">Then they throw the pufflings into the sky. </p>
<p begin="00:01:11.50" dur="00:00:02.20">How do the pufflings get lost?</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.00" dur="00:00:02.60">The pufflings leave their nests in the cliffs.  </p>
<p begin="00:01:18.70" dur="00:00:02.00">They fly out to the sea. </p>
<p begin="00:01:22.00" dur="00:00:03.40">They see the lights of Heimaey and they fly into the town! </p>
<p begin="00:01:29.00" dur="00:00:02.40">People find the puffins on the streets.  </p>
<p begin="00:01:31.50" dur="00:00:02.60">The children of Heimaey help them. </p>
<p begin="00:01:34.55" dur="00:00:05.50">Each night in summer, mothers and fathers go with their children to look for lost pufflings.  </p>
<p begin="00:01:40.10" dur="00:00:02.00">They use flashlights. </p>
<p begin="00:01:43.30" dur="00:00:03.00">The pier is a good place to look for pufflings.</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.80" dur="00:00:02.00">They rescue the pufflings from the streets.  </p>
<p begin="00:02:01.00" dur="00:00:01.40">It’s hard work.</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.20" dur="00:00:04.30">Olaf Holm and his six-year-old son Andrew are looking for pufflings.</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.80" dur="00:00:01.50">They look carefully.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.45" dur="00:00:01.80">They have a bird! </p>
<p begin="00:02:15.65" dur="00:00:03.00">"We came across the parking lot. And saw the silhouette." </p>
<p begin="00:02:18.70" dur="00:00:04.05">"It looked like a little pufflin, and sure enough there he was right in the middle of the parking lot." </p>
<p begin="00:02:22.76" dur="00:00:02.00">"We jumped out. And we got him."</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.50" dur="00:00:03.30">The next day, the children take the birds to the beach.</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.00" dur="00:00:02.70">The children point the birds to the sea. </p>
<p begin="00:02:40.85" dur="00:00:02.70">They throw the young puffins to the sea. </p>
<p begin="00:02:45.40" dur="00:00:03.00">The little puffins swim or fly to safety.</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.85" dur="00:00:02.10">The children like their job.</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.40" dur="00:00:02.00">They are happy.</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.97" dur="00:00:03.10">There are eight to ten million puffins in Iceland.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.20" dur="00:00:03.45">Every year, the children work to look for puffins.</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.50" dur="00:00:03.60">Here, children of Heimaey rescue lost pufflings.</p>
