<p begin="00:00:04.00" dur="00:00:04.50">When an animal has a toothache, it doesn’t go to the dentist’s office.</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.50" dur="00:00:06.50">Dr. Sarah de Sanz is a 'people dentist'. She treats human patients in her office in San Francisco.</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.90" dur="00:00:05.10">However, she sometimes treats patients who don’t come to her office, or sit in her chair. </p>
<p begin="00:00:24.20" dur="00:00:02.18">What kind of patients are these? </p>
<p begin="00:00:26.40" dur="00:00:01.38">Animals!</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.80" dur="00:00:03.20">Dr. de Sanz is a part-time zoo dentist.</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.30" dur="00:00:05.00">She and her father, Dr. Paul Brown, work in the San Francisco area.</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.80" dur="00:00:07.20">They do checkups, fillings, and other dental work on anyone—or anything—that needs them. </p>
<p begin="00:00:44.20" dur="00:00:02.30">"Yes, I’m happy. I think it’s a wonderful job."  </p>
<p begin="00:00:47.30" dur="00:00:03.00">Going to the dentist is frightening for a lot of people.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.80" dur="00:00:04.50">But when a dentist treats a zoo animal, it’s the patient that can be scary. </p>
<p begin="00:00:56.20" dur="00:00:03.60">Some of these patients can bite off a dentist’s hand.</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.30" dur="00:00:04.90">Dr. de Sanz and Dr. Brown work in the most dangerous animal jaws. </p>
<p begin="00:01:07.30" dur="00:00:01.70">They’re happy to do it.</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.30" dur="00:00:02.00">These animals need them.</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.90" dur="00:00:03.30">These dentists do checkups on zoo animals.</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.00" dur="00:00:04.90">Today, they start with Artie, the sea lion, one of the dentists’ best patients. </p>
<p begin="00:01:22.40" dur="00:00:03.10">"He’s an excellent dental patient; he’s better than most people."</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.80" dur="00:00:01.68">"Aren’t you, Artie? Aren’t you?"</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.50" dur="00:00:03.48">"So far as we know, he is quite an old animal."</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.00" dur="00:00:07.48">"He’s 30 years old, which is twice their normal life expectancy...and he’s happy about it...</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.50" dur="00:00:09.20">so we’re going to just look at his teeth and see if he has any particular dental problems."</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.50" dur="00:00:01.60">They take an X-ray.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.50" dur="00:00:01.70">They get a clear picture.</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.00" dur="00:00:02.10">Artie’s checkup goes well.</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.90" dur="00:00:05.10">Artie’s teeth are fine: not bad for a 30-year-old who’s never brushed his teeth! </p>
<p begin="00:02:06.00" dur="00:00:01.40">"Want to hear him say 'ah'?"</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.50" dur="00:00:07.00">"Yeah! Could you say 'ah' please? You are an excellent patient!"</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.80" dur="00:00:03.98">The next visit is Dr. Brown’s favorite animal—the elephant. </p>
<p begin="00:02:18.80" dur="00:00:03.08">He likes elephants because they have interesting teeth.</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.90" dur="00:00:02.90">"This is an elephant molar."</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.90" dur="00:00:06.78">Elephants get six sets of teeth in a lifetime. When the last set is gone, they can no longer eat and will die.</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.70" dur="00:00:04.50">"This is Sue. She’s a ten-year-old little female African elephant."</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.50" dur="00:00:02.70">An elephant’s tusks are really teeth. </p>
<p begin="00:02:41.00" dur="00:00:03.80">The dentists check the teeth in Sue’s mouth, and her tusks.</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.00" dur="00:00:03.10">"Perfect! She’s in great shape. Her teeth look wonderful!" </p>
<p begin="00:02:49.00" dur="00:00:07.00">Sue is the perfect patient and gets an excellent report. But not all animals do so well...</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.40" dur="00:00:04.20">The next patient is the San Francisco Zoo’s rare black jaguar. </p>
<p begin="00:03:03.50" dur="00:00:03.80">Sandy has a terrible toothache and needs surgery. </p>
<p begin="00:03:07.80" dur="00:00:03.50">"Unfortunately we just can’t walk up to her and say 'Can I look in your mouth?'"</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.70" dur="00:00:08.40">"You may lose a few fingers in the process, as well as maybe your head! So therefore this animal has to be anesthetized in order for us to look at it."</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.30" dur="00:00:02.50">Making an animal sleep is difficult.</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.90" dur="00:00:3.00">Sandy is 21 years old.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.00" dur="00:00:02.40">They take her to the operating room.</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.30" dur="00:00:02.00">Everyone is worried. </p>
<p begin="00:03:39.50" dur="00:00:02.10">They start the surgery. </p>
<p begin="00:03:42.00" dur="00:00:02.40">Suddenly there’s a problem.</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.40" dur="00:00:02.30">“Hey Ron, why don’t you come over here?”</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.40" dur="00:00:01.80">Sandy stops breathing! </p>
<p begin="00:03:49.60" dur="00:00:05.00">First the doctors give her oxygen. Sandy takes one breath per minute!</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.30" dur="00:00:01.70">The team acts quickly. </p>
<p begin="00:03:57.30" dur="00:00:05.80">Sandy’s teeth are very bad. She needs two root canals—and a filling! </p>
<p begin="00:04:03.60" dur="00:00:05.88">Dr. de Sanz and Dr. Brown must now work carefully and quickly to take out the nerve of each bad tooth </p>
<p begin="00:04:09.50" dur="00:00:02.70">and then put fillings in the holes that are left.</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.90" dur="00:00:02.90">After a lot of hard work—the surgery is over. </p>
<p begin="00:04:17.20" dur="00:00:03.10">The jaguar’s visit with the dentists is finished.</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.00" dur="00:00:04.70">Sandy will feel well again. She won’t have a toothache!</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.10" dur="00:00:02.70">The zoo dentists finish another day.</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.00" dur="00:00:03.60">It’s all in a day’s work for these zoo dentists!</p>
