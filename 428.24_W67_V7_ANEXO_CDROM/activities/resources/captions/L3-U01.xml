<p begin="00:00:07.20" dur="00:00:04.85">Each Sunday, the sounds of the Mission Dolores Basilica are heard in San Francisco.</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.50" dur="00:00:04.40">These sounds bring memories of the Spanish who built this church in 1791.</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.80" dur="00:00:03.85">They didn't know it at the time, but it was the start of a special kind of neighborhood:</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.99" dur="00:00:01.00">the Mission District.</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.75" dur="00:00:04.20">Some community members describe the neighborhood as a central part of the city.</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.20" dur="00:00:00.80">Why?</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.50" dur="00:00:02.35">Because it's where the city began long ago.</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.80" dur="00:00:03.80">They feel that understanding the many levels of history here is important. </p>
<p begin="00:00:46.60" dur="00:00:04.95">They also feel that it's a big part of understanding what it means to be a real San Franciscan.</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.90" dur="00:00:04.10">Over the years, immigrants have come here from Ireland, Germany and Italy.</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.60" dur="00:00:04.55">But the most recent immigrants are mainly from Mexico, Central and South America.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.65" dur="00:00:04.00">It's easy to see the style that these recent additions give to the neighborhood.</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.25" dur="00:00:04.10">You can see it on walls, taste it in the food, and hear it in the music!</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.05" dur="00:00:03.50">Juan Pedro Gaffney grew up in the Mission District.</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.65" dur="00:00:03.60">He's the director of the Spanish Choir of San Francisco.</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.65" dur="00:00:05.25">In the past, the group has performed to raise money for people after natural disasters in Central America.</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.90" dur="00:00:03.25">Many people here have friends and relatives in Latin America.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.10" dur="00:00:04.35">Juan Pedro says that the local community here feels a sense of common involvement.</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.35" dur="00:00:03.00">They really care when a neighboring nation is in pain.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.35" dur="00:00:04.20">In good times and bad, the music of The Mission deeply affects everyone.</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.50" dur="00:00:04.60">Juan Pedro explains that it's always been a basic part of cultural identity here.</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.35" dur="00:00:04.50">It's colorful, lively, and--according to Juan Pedro--absolutely "jumping"!</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.90" dur="00:00:04.25">But it isn't just the music...the art of The Mission is full of life as well.</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.90" dur="00:00:04.40">The local art community here stays close to the area's culture and tradition.</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.30" dur="00:00:04.20">A local arts organization leads people on walks through the district.</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.90" dur="00:00:04.00">They visit streets like Balmy Alley, which is famous for its murals.</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.55" dur="00:00:03.90">"What happens is, the murals begin to reflect the community itself."</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.50" dur="00:00:06.55">In 1984, Artist Ray Patlan helped paint a series of murals with the theme, Peace in Central America.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.55" dur="00:00:04.10">But while the district remains mainly Latino, it's no longer 1984.</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.50" dur="00:00:04.25">Politics and the world have changed; the art of the Mission has changed as well.</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.85" dur="00:00:05.05">Patlan says that the art is a part of the streets, but also a reflection of the community.</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.90" dur="00:00:03.00">As the community changes, the murals change, too.</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.50" dur="00:00:04.10">The mural messages are always changing, but they're still very powerful.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.05" dur="00:00:02.75">"It's great! It's like coming home to a piece of art every day you know?"</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.05" dur="00:00:04.00">"Every time we drive up it's just very...uh...you know, sort of vibrant."</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.05" dur="00:00:03.50">The artists here have strong feelings about the work they do.</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.05" dur="00:00:04.50">One artist explains that the artists of The Mission are fighting for fairness in the community.</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.00" dur="00:00:02.05">They're also fighting to help the environment.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.85" dur="00:00:02.35">In the industrial area of the Mission District,</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.25" dur="00:00:05.05">this group of artists maintains its cultural identity in traditional San Francisco style.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.15" dur="00:00:05.30">Many artists feel that The Mission is a successful neighborhood where new immigrants are welcome.</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.30" dur="00:00:02.75">"People see that they're not so different from each other."</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.10" dur="00:00:02.55">"There's a lot of things that bind them through culture and tradition."</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.20" dur="00:00:04.85">Saint Peter's Church is another place that understands the closeness between culture and tradition.</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.75" dur="00:00:05.45">Mission Dolores was the foundation of The Mission, but Saint Peter's is another strong base in the area.</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.00" dur="00:00:02.55">Father Dan McGuire is the leader of Saint Peter's.</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.50" dur="00:00:04.50">"And the beauty of this particular parish is that the different cultures from Latin America</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.20" dur="00:00:05.05">...the different countries of Latin America come together here and they really form a common unity."</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.50" dur="00:00:05.75">The people who come here are from all over Latin America; places like Mexico, El Salvador, and Peru.</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.95" dur="00:00:02.50">"And they bring with them the best of their own country:</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.90" dur="00:00:03.80">particularly their interest in their families, their interests in their traditions."</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.95" dur="00:00:04.00">"And what I see going on here in a very, very positive way</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.25" dur="00:00:04.55">is an integration of the best of Latin American culture now, with American culture."</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.45" dur="00:00:05.55">In the Mission District, immigrants are often able to fit into a new society very easily.</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.50" dur="00:00:02.70">Why? Because the environment here is so comfortable.</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.80" dur="00:00:06.50">It may be this comfortable feeling that makes this multi-cultural community a very special kind of neighborhood!</p>
