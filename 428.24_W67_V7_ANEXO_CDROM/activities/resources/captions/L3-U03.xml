<p begin="00:00:01.85" dur="00:00:04.25">We hear a lot about global warming, but an entire country in danger of sinking?</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.00" dur="00:00:02.50">That's what they're worried about in the Netherlands.</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.95" dur="00:00:05.60">Global warming is expected to cause the sea level to rise between four inches and three feet this century.</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.55" dur="00:00:03.15">So it's no wonder the Dutch take climate changes very seriously.</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.50" dur="00:00:02.15">The Dutch have long been at war with water.</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.20" dur="00:00:02.00">With half of their country below sea level,</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.35" dur="00:00:03.60">they've built elaborate dikes and windmill systems to preserve their farmland.</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.15" dur="00:00:03.95">But climate change and rising seas are causing the Netherlands to sink even more.</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.50" dur="00:00:04.35">And scientists are worried that dikes and gates may not be able to hold the water much longer.</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.35" dur="00:00:03.30">"Because what we think that will going to happen is</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.75" dur="00:00:04.10">that there will be a climate change, which now starts already a little bit,</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.40" dur="00:00:03.00">and this will cause not only the sea to rise,</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.05" dur="00:00:06.71">but also give heavy rains in winter, but also drier summers..."</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.56" dur="00:00:06.00">"Well, imagine, that the Dutch people, they already struggling for centuries</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.70" dur="00:00:03.40"> with the sea, the North Sea, which is our border to the North Sea."</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.60" dur="00:00:05.50">"And we have experienced many, many floods, taking away the lives of hundred thousands of Dutch people."</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.80" dur="00:00:05.15">"So, coastal defense, it simply had to become a Dutch discipline,</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.45" dur="00:00:03.10">because even nowadays, half of the country is below sea level."</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.15" dur="00:00:05.55">"And that will become worse if the greenhouse effect really takes place, as forecasted by the scientists."</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.05" dur="00:00:05.50">Thirty to forty percent of the country's land was created by man, pumping water out from marshlands.</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.15" dur="00:00:03.75">But as water was pumped out, the land settled lower and lower.</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.85" dur="00:00:03.10">Today more than ten million people live below sea level,</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.20" dur="00:00:03.90">on land that only stays dry because of the constant work of pumps and dikes.</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.35" dur="00:00:04.00">One idea has been radical ... instead of struggling so hard,</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.85" dur="00:00:02.80">why not give some of the country back to the sea?</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.00" dur="00:00:07.35">"We always struggled, we always fought the sea. But that might be quite stupid in future."</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.60" dur="00:00:05.20">"It might be...eh...necessary to give a lot of land back to the sea."</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.00" dur="00:00:03.20">"Because the sea and the rivers simply need space."</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.95" dur="00:00:04.35">The idea is to let water back into hundreds of miles of the lowest-lying farm land.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.60" dur="00:00:04.00">These new flood control lakes could also be used for recreation and wildlife.</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.40" dur="00:00:04.00">Dikes would be moved inland, opening large areas of sand dunes to the tides.</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.10" dur="00:00:05.85">"We have to be creative. It is possible to build ...eh...floating houses."</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.75" dur="00:00:05.10">"We do it now in Ijberg, near Amsterdam, there's a new part of city,</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.65" dur="00:00:03.80">and parts of it will be...eh...floating."</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.95" dur="00:00:05.75">"If you see it, you don't see it's a boat. It's a big house, with a roof and everything."</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.20" dur="00:00:03.50">"People like to live near the water."</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.00" dur="00:00:04.60">But after all the work it took to get rid of the water in the first place, there is resistance.</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.20" dur="00:00:05.45">"We have an old generation that has suffered flooding and that is convinced</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.85" dur="00:00:06.40">that the only way to live in Holland is really fight the water and build dikes as hard as you can."</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.55" dur="00:00:03.85">But Holland also has a younger generation who look at water as something</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.45" dur="00:00:02.65">which brings pleasure and which brings a pretty landscape.</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.20" dur="00:00:03.15">Regardless of what is decided, a lot of people believe</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.45" dur="00:00:03.70">that a fundamental shift in the way the Dutch approach water is inevitable.</p>
