<p begin="00:00:05.10" dur="00:00:03.95">In a small village high in the Andes, it all starts with the sheep</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.30" dur="00:00:03.00">—just one, that loses it's warm, winter wool.</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.50" dur="00:00:05.40">First, a few people from the village, or villagers, catch the sheep and prepare the knife.</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.60" dur="00:00:03.75">Then, they carefully tie up the sheep so that it can't move.</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.25" dur="00:00:03.45">Finally, they use the knife to cut the sheep's winter coat of wool.</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.20" dur="00:00:04.95">After that, one of the newest and most important industries in Chinchero begins.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.10" dur="00:00:04.85">The methods they use are traditional, but these villagers are part of something new.</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.10" dur="00:00:03.50">The wool they're collecting is for a new and different business--</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.70" dur="00:00:03.05">a weavers' cooperative that the women here manage.</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.20" dur="00:00:05.00">Every Monday and Saturday, 46 women and girls cut wool from their sheep and llamas.</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.80" dur="00:00:03.10">Then, they spin it into yarn for making cloth.</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.30" dur="00:00:05.65">Nilda Cayanupa is the leader of the Center for Traditional Textiles which manages the cooperative.</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.95" dur="00:00:04.50">"Any of my age in my town was learning to weave."</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.65" dur="00:00:03.40">"So it was kind of sad that the weaving was disappearing."</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.05" dur="00:00:08.00">"So, because that, I always my dream was that the younger generation should learn so the weaving won't die."</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.65" dur="00:00:04.25">Nilda grew up in the Andean countryside, where many of the men are farmers.</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.50" dur="00:00:01.40">"Chinchero is a farming village."</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.20" dur="00:00:03.25">"We are the best—I'm not saying because I am from this village</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.45" dur="00:00:05.00">—but we are the best producers of the potatoes, and many things like quinoa...barley..."</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.35" dur="00:00:02.30">Farming has long been a tradition in Chinchero.</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.00" dur="00:00:06.00">Many farmers here continue the traditions of the Inca people who lived in the Andes for centuries.</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.50" dur="00:00:04.10">However, farming no longer brings in enough money to support a whole family here.</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.50" dur="00:00:03.50">So, with the changes in the economy, traditional ideas are changing, too.</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.00" dur="00:00:05.25">Until now it's always been the men who have farmed and the women have cooked and cared for the children.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.30" dur="00:00:04.00">They have also taken wool from the sheep and woven it into cloth.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.50" dur="00:00:03.30">It's this weaving thats now becoming more and more important.</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.40" dur="00:00:04.30">Nilda says that these women weavers are becoming the main economic supporters of the family.</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.40" dur="00:00:04.20">As an example, she tells of one woman whose husband has started helping with the sheep.</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.10" dur="00:00:06.00">She explains that this wasn't very common in the past. Men only farmed the land and didn't help with weaving.</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.00" dur="00:00:03.30">"But today, this group of the ladies you know, can make...not a lot of money</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.00" dur="00:00:02.05">...but a reasonable amount of money."</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.50" dur="00:00:07.00">Now in Chinchero, weaving isn't just a tradition. It's a way to make money and live well.</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.30" dur="00:00:04.90">Weaving has also become more important for the culture of Chinchero.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.20" dur="00:00:06.00">It has become a way to make the textile tradition stronger and to keep a part of the past alive.</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.00" dur="00:00:04.00">"I learned when I was in the third grade of school with very basic weaving."</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.05" dur="00:00:05.10">"Today, I weave blankets, shawls, ponchos, and prepare my own yarn."</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.20" dur="00:00:03.00">Older women now teach the younger girls.</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.00" dur="00:00:03.25">The goal is to bring back the strength of the textile tradition of the past.</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.40" dur="00:00:02.40">They want to keep the Peruvian weaving traditions alive.</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.40" dur="00:00:04.40">As the young women of Chinchero learn to weave, they also learn to be self-sufficient.</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.40" dur="00:00:03.10">They can sell the blankets and clothes that they make in their free time.</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.00" dur="00:00:06.45">"I do my weaving in my house, in the afternoons and early morning. And here on Monday and Saturday, too."</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.40" dur="00:00:05.10">Weaving groups like the Chinchero cooperative are giving new life to the textile tradition.</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.05" dur="00:00:06.10">In the end, their cooperative may prove that many threads together are stronger than one alone.</p>
