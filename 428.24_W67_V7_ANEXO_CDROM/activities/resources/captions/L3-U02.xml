<p begin="00:00:03.60" dur="00:00:05.60">Gianni Golfera is blindfolded, but he can still show these people something that's amazing.</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.00" dur="00:00:02.35">The young Italian man calls it 'the art of memory.'</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.50" dur="00:00:02.75">First, the people randomly choose sixty numbers.</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.85" dur="00:00:02.75">After that, a helper reads the numbers to Gianni.</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.25" dur="00:00:03.60">Then, Gianni repeats the numbers in the correct order from memory.</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.55" dur="00:00:05.00">First in the order he heard them. Then, he does it againâ€”backwards!</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.70" dur="00:00:02.90">"It's a kind of memory that is connected to what I see."</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.05" dur="00:00:05.10">"It means that every idea I learn, everything I read, becomes a part of me."</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.70" dur="00:00:05.90">"Normally, a person who doesn't have this gift and who hasn't studied memory tends to just forget things."</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.10" dur="00:00:02.40">"Even an entire book. Not me."</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.60" dur="00:00:05.00">Gianni has a very special kind of memory. He has memorized more than 250 books.</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.30" dur="00:00:04.15">He also says that he can remember every detail of every day of this life--</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.85" dur="00:00:02.65">from the time when he was less than one year old!</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.00" dur="00:00:05.10">Memory is very difficult to understand, and scientists don't really know how it works.</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.40" dur="00:00:04.35">The Golfera family genes may hold important information about Gianni's memory.</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.30" dur="00:00:03.95">Neurobiologist Dr. Antonio Malgaroli plans to compare the</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.45" dur="00:00:03.25">Golfera family's genes with the genes of more forgetful families.</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.25" dur="00:00:04.75">"The crucial question is to understand which is the contribution from heredity,</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.05" dur="00:00:02.80">and which is the contribution that comes from the environment."</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.20" dur="00:00:03.85">When we process new information, such as reading a book or newspaper,</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.20" dur="00:00:02.50">it goes into our brains through the hippocampus.</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.85" dur="00:00:02.00">There, it's coded as memory.</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.05" dur="00:00:05.50">But how is memory coded? Where is it stored? Why is it stored there? Nobody knows.</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.35" dur="00:00:02.90">Nobody knows why some people lose their memories either.</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.50" dur="00:00:02.95">Or why so few, like Gianni, never forget things.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.00" dur="00:00:04.00">Researchers are now studying how memory and learning change the brain.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.25" dur="00:00:03.65">They're also trying to match those changes to specific genes.</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.25" dur="00:00:04.15">Some research shows that a great memory may not depend on the right DNA.</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.20" dur="00:00:05.65">"If you really need to use your brain capacity to store some kind of information, you have this ability."</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.40" dur="00:00:01.50">"It's just a matter of exercise."</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.80" dur="00:00:04.65">The same idea is true for Gianni. His genes are only part of the story.</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.95" dur="00:00:04.00">Since the age of 11, he's been training his brain to remember.</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.35" dur="00:00:03.80">He practices continuously to improve the power of his memory.</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.95" dur="00:00:03.70">He has even memorized a whole series of historical books.</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.75" dur="00:00:04.35">For Gianni, improving his memory has become almost like a full-time job.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.85" dur="00:00:03.05">"Golfera has an extraordinary ability."</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.55" dur="00:00:04.90">"The question is...you know...how much it's really because of... you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.50" dur="00:00:06.00">the Golfera family genes, and how much comes from his sort of...you know...maniac type of activity."</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.95" dur="00:00:04.90">Gianni's life is not all about science, though. He has a relatively normal life.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.10" dur="00:00:04.00">He has a dog and a girlfriend. He likes to take time away from work.</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.50" dur="00:00:04.30">In other words, he's just like other people, and that's part of what's so interesting.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.40" dur="00:00:02.90">His genes may be partly responsible for his great memory.</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.75" dur="00:00:04.99">However, researchers think that it's mainly because of his very hard work. Gianni agrees.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.25" dur="00:00:01.25">He even offers proof.</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.20" dur="00:00:03.45">He holds classes to teach people how to improve their memories.</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.00" dur="00:00:05.90">His system involves organization and hard work--basically learning how to 'remember to remember.'</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.75" dur="00:00:03.65">"I think the only problem with memory is getting the correct order."</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.65" dur="00:00:02.85">"There's a lot of brain space, so I think there are no limits."</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.75" dur="00:00:03.50">If there is a memory gene, Gianni Golfera probably has it.</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.85" dur="00:00:04.25">But the success of 'The Memory Man' may be more about determination than DNA.</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.85" dur="00:00:04.40">Gianni's practice and hard work are making his memory even better.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.35" dur="00:00:06.00">He might just be showing scientists that a great memory can be made, and not just born!</p>
