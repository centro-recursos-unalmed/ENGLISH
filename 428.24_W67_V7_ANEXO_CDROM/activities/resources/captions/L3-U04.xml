<p begin="00:00:05.10" dur="00:00:03.50">The souk in the city of Fes is Morocco's oldest market.</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.00" dur="00:00:05.20">In one of its small stalls, a craftsman is making patterns on a metal tabletop.</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.85" dur="00:00:02.60">But all around him, people are making deals.</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.00" dur="00:00:02.10">This is business, Moroccan-style.</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.80" dur="00:00:04.20">Sales in the souk happen face-to-face; it's very personal and very busy!</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.45" dur="00:00:02.70">The vendors have everything a shopper could want.</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.00" dur="00:00:04.05">Sandals are next to fish bowls, and nearby, birds in cages watch the scene.</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.30" dur="00:00:03.30">One vendor sells kaftans, others sell slippers or jewelry.</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.45" dur="00:00:03.50">Across the alley, a man sells dates and apricots to hungry shoppers.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.65" dur="00:00:03.10">In the souk, there really is something for everyone.</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.90" dur="00:00:04.25">And in the city of Fes, a certain kind of small, red hat is very easy to find.</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.15" dur="00:00:02.55">The fez was created here and named after the city.</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.95" dur="00:00:03.40">A visit to the souk is a lesson in Moroccan bargaining culture.</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.65" dur="00:00:04.35">For visitors, the question is not 'What should I buy?' but 'How should I buy it?'</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.45" dur="00:00:02.90">That's where they get a real education in making a deal.</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.65" dur="00:00:02.45">"You have to start yourself at one third or something,</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.30" dur="00:00:02.00">and then you bargain up to 50 percent."</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.50" dur="00:00:03.75">"Yeah, and they go down twice as hard as we go up with the price."</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.65" dur="00:00:04.25">"So, then you get it at half the price they say at first."</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.05" dur="00:00:01.00">"But it's really a game."</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.15" dur="00:00:05.90">"The Moroccans are very good at bargaining and they say they are the best in the world."</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.70" dur="00:00:03.65">"You know, here in Moroccan culture, for everything you should bargain."</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.51" dur="00:00:01.70">"We don't have really a fixed price."</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.60" dur="00:00:02.60">In the souk, shopping is an exercise in bargaining.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.75" dur="00:00:03.35">Here, it's the natural thing to do, and just about everyone does it.</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.75" dur="00:00:03.95">However, visitors who want to practice making a deal here had better be careful!</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.00" dur="00:00:02.30">They ought to know a few things first:</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.55" dur="00:00:02.55">beginners at bargaining pay more. How much more?</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.95" dur="00:00:04.75">"Sometimes 20, 30 percent more...over than the price that the Moroccan people pay."</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.45" dur="00:00:05.40">"So you should always...for example, if he charges you 1,000 dirham, you give him 600 dirham"</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.15" dur="00:00:02.95">then you go up, he go down, and then you can arrange between you."</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.35" dur="00:00:02.05">Vendors aren't trying to cheat customers.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.75" dur="00:00:02.25">It's like a test to find out who's the best bargainer.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.80" dur="00:00:03.65">"Some customers pay more than another one...we find </p>
<p begin="00:02:24.75" dur="00:00:04.40">customers...more easy...they don't bargain too much."</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.55" dur="00:00:03.00">The real test for any bargainer is the carpet shop.</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.95" dur="00:00:03.45">This is where the sellers really pressure customers to buy something.</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.00" dur="00:00:03.25">"Excuse me, you want to buy camel for the price of donkey?"</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.45" dur="00:00:03.25">"Impossible. No, that's too low, believe me, that's too low."</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.05" dur="00:00:03.80">"Once you end up in a shop, you sit there drinking tea, and you say, 'I don't want to buy anything.'"</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.05" dur="00:00:03.40">"But then it's like, 'Well, just offer a price ... offer a price. 500?'"</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.75" dur="00:00:03.40">"'What's your best price?' And you're like, 'We don't want to buy it.' And they're like, 'Okay, 300!'"</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.60" dur="00:00:01.70">But it's all part of the game.</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.60" dur="00:00:05.20">"Well we ask a little bit high price because everyone comes with an intention to bargain."</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.80" dur="00:00:06.80">They know that in Morocco they bargain a lot, so of course we leave a step to make discounts and haggling the price."</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.20" dur="00:00:03.35">Some shoppers enjoy the challenge too. </p>
<p begin="00:03:16.80" dur="00:00:05.70">"The secret is looking very carefully at how they do it. And watch them,</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.50" dur="00:00:05.50">how they move...and then go step by step, and see where you end."</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.20" dur="00:00:05.30">There is one thing that all tourists should watch out for: they shouldn't buy too much!</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.50" dur="00:00:05.35">"The thing is, they make it so cheap for you! They start up so high, and at the end it sounds so cheap."</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.00" dur="00:00:03.50">"It's only one sixth of the price, or one eighth of the price."</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.50" dur="00:00:01.90">"Well, for this money, I can't leave it!"</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.95" dur="00:00:04.50">For some visitors to Fes, it may be difficult to leave without buying more than they planned.</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.90" dur="00:00:04.70">One thing here is certainâ€”at the souk, everyone can make a deal!</p>
