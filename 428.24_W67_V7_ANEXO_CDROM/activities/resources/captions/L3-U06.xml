<p begin="00:00:02.10" dur="00:00:03.30">Long before the land grew roads and towns.</p>
<p begin="00:00:5.45" dur="00:00:03.30">Long before the first westerners arrived.</p>
<p begin="00:00:8.75" dur="00:00:03.90">Long before humans here even had a word for art.</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.35" dur="00:00:03.75">The rock artists of Australia were drawing the dreamtime.</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.10" dur="00:00:05.60">The dreamtime, for the aboriginal people, is their story of creation.</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.80" dur="00:00:07.75">That time so very long ago when rocks and animals and plants and people first sprang from the earth.</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.00" dur="00:00:07.00">And their beliefs about the dreamtime are reflected in ancient paintings on rock.</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.20" dur="00:00:05.60">Untold numbers of them, buried in the stone country of Kakadu National Park.</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.85" dur="00:00:04.40">Thompson Yulidgirru still paints in the time honored way.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.30" dur="00:00:07.50">"When I used to go stay with my grandfather, I used to tell him please...tell me the stories of my ancestors."</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.20" dur="00:00:04.40">The aboriginal people of Australia are believed to have inhabited this land</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.60" dur="00:00:03.50">for at least forty thousand, maybe a hundred thousand years.</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.35" dur="00:00:04.90">That would make them the oldest continuous human culture on the planet.</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.95" dur="00:00:05.05">And their ancient art is like a primitive history book and guide for living.</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.85" dur="00:00:06.25">Pictures tell a story here of how birds warn kangaroos of approaching hunters.</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.40" dur="00:00:03.00">And here, the tale of war.</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.70" dur="00:00:03.85">Aboriginal people of old believed the pictures imparted powers:</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.65" dur="00:00:05.65">paint a harvest of fat fish, and chances are one would come your way.</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.25" dur="00:00:07.80">Seasons played a big a role in their lives, so many of the images were painted each year at a specific time...</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.50" dur="00:00:05.00">The artists used red ochre and yellow ochre made of soil and white clay.</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.60" dur="00:00:04.10">Certain clans were responsible for painting specific animals.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.00" dur="00:00:05.85">If your group painted turtles...that's what you painted, not kangaroos.</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.90" dur="00:00:06.30">It was all seen as magic, all ceremonial, part of keeping the earth healthy.</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.30" dur="00:00:06.95">The last pure rock artists died in the 1960's, and modern aboriginal artists paint</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.30" dur="00:00:06.00">on bark, paper, wood, making their work portable and valuable.</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.50" dur="00:00:06.30">But the oldest works of rock art here are very slowly losing the battle with time.</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.00" dur="00:00:07.20">Centuries of monsoon rains, insects and tiny reptiles crawling over them, brushing away the grains of color.</p>
