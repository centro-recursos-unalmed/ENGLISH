<p begin="00:00:03.05" dur="00:00:04.50">The island of Cheju off the coast of South Korea is famous for its natural beauty.</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.10" dur="00:00:03.20">It's also known for a group of women divers called "haenyos".</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.00" dur="00:00:03.25">These women dive into the sea every day to look for seafood.</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.75" dur="00:00:03.20">It's their job, and it's difficult and very dangerous work.</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.45" dur="00:00:02.00">They do not use oxygen tanks.</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.13" dur="00:00:03.35">They can hold their breath and stay underwater for up to five minutes!</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.35" dur="00:00:04.00">For hundreds of years, the women of Cheju have made their living from the sea.</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.50" dur="00:00:04.20">They dive into the cold waters and catch octopus, abalone, and sea urchins.</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.15" dur="00:00:03.20">However, these women divers on Cheju may be the last.</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.52" dur="00:00:02.78">Things on this small island are changing. </p>
<p begin="00:00:53.95" dur="00:00:01.60">Sunny Hong is different. </p>
<p begin="00:00:55.60" dur="00:00:01.40">She isn't a diver. </p>
<p begin="00:00:57.05" dur="00:00:01.50">She is a tour guide. </p>
<p begin="00:00:58.70" dur="00:00:01.55">She doesn't catch fish.</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.35" dur="00:00:02.00">She helps tourists that come to the island.</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.25" dur="00:00:14.00">"I wanted to find some kind of job which I can use my English, and also this kind of job is (how can I say) fit to my aptitude."</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.25" dur="00:00:01.60">Sunny speaks English. </p>
<p begin="00:01:20.95" dur="00:00:01.70">She doesn't have to dive. </p>
<p begin="00:01:22.75" dur="00:00:03.00">However, all the other women in her family are divers. </p>
<p begin="00:01:29.25" dur="00:00:02.50">"This is my aunt, Ms. Hong."</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.70" dur="00:00:02.40">"She's 63 years old..."</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.50" dur="00:00:05.10">"She started diving when she was just thirteen, so almost fifty years now."</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.65" dur="00:00:03.30">Sunny's aunt and her friends have been diving nearly all of their lives!</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.15" dur="00:00:01.50">"They didn't have a choice."</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.15" dur="00:00:13.25">"And also, they were born in a sea village, so they had to be a woman diver, and there's nothing they can do except woman diver."</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.80" dur="00:00:02.00">The job is very dangerous.</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.90" dur="00:00:02.10">In Cheju, all the divers are women. </p>
<p begin="00:02:12.10" dur="00:00:01.50">Men are not divers. </p>
<p begin="00:02:14.90" dur="00:00:02.85">The youngest diver on the island is 45 years old. </p>
<p begin="00:02:18.40" dur="00:00:02.00">The oldest is 75. </p>
<p begin="00:02:20.45" dur="00:00:03.00">These women dive for five to six hours every day!</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.10" dur="00:00:02.10">But, why do they keep diving?</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.95" dur="00:00:01.50">The answer is easy. </p>
<p begin="00:02:29.65" dur="00:00:02.50">Sixty-year-old Song Ho has had a good day. </p>
<p begin="00:02:32.40" dur="00:00:03.25">She can make up to 300 U.S. dollars in a day!</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.75" dur="00:00:02.40">Diving is still a big business in Cheju. </p>
<p begin="00:02:39.40" dur="00:00:03.00">The women can use the money to educate their children.</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.10" dur="00:00:05.20">"I don't want to be a woman diver. I think I am lucky."</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.40" dur="00:00:02.50">The young people of Cheju have more opportunities. </p>
<p begin="00:03:00.30" dur="00:00:04.00">Sunny's aunt and her friends may just be the last of the Cheju women divers.</p>
