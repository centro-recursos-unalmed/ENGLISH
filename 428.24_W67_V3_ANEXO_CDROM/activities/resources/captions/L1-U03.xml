<p begin="00:00:00.70" dur="00:00:03.30">At the National Detector Dog Training Center in Orlando, Florida</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.55" dur="00:00:01.90">every day has a noisy start.</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.00" dur="00:00:01.00">"Hey Guys! Hey Guys! Hey!"</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.05" dur="00:00:02.50">This is especially true for canine instructor Brent Heldt.</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.30" dur="00:00:03.00">A half a dozen beagles are waiting for their morning run.</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.30" dur="00:00:02.80">The first lucky dog is a beagle called Stockton.</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.60" dur="00:00:01.70">"Go on, go get it! Go get it!"</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.55" dur="00:00:02.70">Stockton is learning to become a detector dog. </p>
<p begin="00:00:22.80" dur="00:00:03.03">Before Heldt and Stockton start work, it is time for play.</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.20" dur="00:00:02.50">"Come on get some! Come on! Come on!"</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.90" dur="00:00:01.75">"Their personalities are all very different."</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.90" dur="00:00:01.50">"That's what makes this job so cool."</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.49" dur="00:00:04.31">"I mean, every time I train these guys, I learn something different...every time."</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.95" dur="00:00:01.20">"We're going to work. Come on, Hoss."</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.25" dur="00:00:01.00">"You big Hoss!"</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.90" dur="00:00:03.85">Detector dogs work in international airports and look for illegal imports,</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.06" dur="00:00:03.30">like citrus fruits, mangoes, and apples that may carry diseases.</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.03" dur="00:00:03.00">They also sniff for meat products that may carry diseases.</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.05" dur="00:00:06.20">At twenty-one international airports around the United States every day, dogs help to find this food.</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.95" dur="00:00:03.08">But the dogs have to do this without bothering passengers who are </p>
<p begin="00:01:04.18" dur="00:00:03.00">bringing home safe and legal gifts to their friends and family.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.20" dur="00:00:03.00">That's where the National Detector Dog Training Center comes in.</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.40" dur="00:00:02.79">"What we got here is a target box, it's called 'mixed'."</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.35" dur="00:00:03.05">"The reasons I call it 'mixed' is because thats exactly what it is."</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.57" dur="00:00:01.07">"It's mixed odor."</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.80" dur="00:00:03.30">"What I have here...We have some beef jerky."</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.95" dur="00:00:07.60">"I have the beef odor,  I have an apple odor, I have my citrus odor, and I have my mango odor."</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.55" dur="00:00:01.40">"So should we try the bags now?"</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.05" dur="00:00:01.40">"Lets go try the hand bags."</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.50" dur="00:00:02.30">"Come on. Good boy! Thats a good boy!"</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.40" dur="00:00:03.10">"What we want the dogs to do, is work the seam of the suitcase</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.10" dur="00:00:02.90">because the odor comes out from the seam."</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.35" dur="00:00:03.20">"What we teach the canine officers and the dogs,</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.55" dur="00:00:02.25">when we breathe the bag, odor is coming out of the bag."</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.25" dur="00:00:01.90">"Whata you got? Whata you got?"</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.30" dur="00:00:03.00">"You got something Stockton? You got something?"</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.55" dur="00:00:03.40">"Oh, boy! You found it, you found the meat"!</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.96" dur="00:00:01.60">"Thats a good boy!"</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.70" dur="00:00:02.50">Things dont always go so smoothly for Stockton though.</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.30" dur="00:00:03.20">On the next test he lies down when he is supposed to sit.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.00" dur="00:00:02.20">On another, he gets too far ahead of Heldt.</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.80" dur="00:00:02.00">"Stockton, wait for me, Bud!"</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.10" dur="00:00:02.00">"You've got to work with me, I'm your partner remember?"</p>  
<p begin="00:02:16.50" dur="00:00:03.40">Even though it's serious work, it always has to be fun for the animal.</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.40" dur="00:00:02.20">So what does it take to be a detector dog?</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.60" dur="00:00:02.00">"Obviously, number one, they have to be great with people and</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.00" dur="00:00:03.00">children because when we work them in the airports, that's what we're working with--</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.20" dur="00:00:02.60">the public coming from foreign countries."</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.50" dur="00:00:03.60">"And they've got to have real good food drive because they work for food."</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.20" dur="00:00:02.30">"Anybody knows who has a beagle...they love food."</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.60" dur="00:00:03.60">"Even after they eat a big dinner, they're still ready to eat some more."</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.30" dur="00:00:04.70">However, even after all that training, not all of the dogs are good enough to become detector dogs.</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.00" dur="00:00:02.90">"For some reason if they don't work out, we place them in homes."</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.30" dur="00:00:02.80">"They stay with us until we can find a home that suits them</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.60" dur="00:00:02.70">and we have applicants on our adoption list all the time."</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.40" dur="00:00:04.10">"And we screen them to make sure they're also a good fit for the dog that we have."</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.70" dur="00:00:02.45">But Stockton is learning quickly.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.40" dur="00:00:02.80">Stockton's chances of becoming a detector dog look very good.</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.40" dur="00:00:04.20">"His demeanor is really meek, he just rolls along kind of like a tortoise."</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.00" dur="00:00:03.40">"Nothing kind of fazes him, so he loves working."</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.70" dur="00:00:02.60">"It's a game to him, which is really important."</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.45" dur="00:00:01.40">"Good job! Good job, very good!"</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.40" dur="00:00:02.10">But when these two partners are working together, </p>
<p begin="00:03:31.50" dur="00:00:03.50">it's easy to see that its not only Stockton who loves his work.</p>
