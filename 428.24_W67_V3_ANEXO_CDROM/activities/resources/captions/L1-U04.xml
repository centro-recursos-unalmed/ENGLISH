<p begin="00:00:01.10" dur="00:00:02.00">Japanese people eat a lot of fish.</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.70" dur="00:00:04.30">Every morning many people go to Tsukiji Seafood Market in Tokyo.</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.30" dur="00:00:04.40">The most expensive fish, and the most dangerous, is the puffer fish,</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.85" dur="00:00:02.50">or as the Japanese call it - "fugu".</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.20" dur="00:00:02.40">Parts of the puffer fish are poisonous.</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.90" dur="00:00:03.50">People who eat the poisonous parts of the fish can die.</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.50" dur="00:00:05.30">However, you can find fugu on more than 80 menus in the Asakusa restaurant area of Tokyo.</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.35" dur="00:00:03.30">Although it is dangerous, people like to eat fugu.</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.55" dur="00:00:04.30">Tom Caradonna is visiting Tokyo because he wants to try fugu. </p>
<p begin="00:00:45.90" dur="00:00:03.20">Tom and his friend Aki are eating at the Matsumoto restaurant.</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.10" dur="00:00:02.55">This famous restaurant is 120 years old.</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.95" dur="00:00:03.60">Everyone knows that the restaurant prepares the fish very carefully.</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.55" dur="00:00:03.30">"I've heard stories about people dying you know,</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.00" dur="00:00:03.50">trying the fugu but it hasn't really concerned me."</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.80" dur="00:00:05.00">Tom isn't worried but many have died because they ate the puffer fish.</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.80" dur="00:00:03.90">At the Matsumoto restaurant, Chef Hayashi prepares the fugu.</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.40" dur="00:00:02.00">"It'll be fine, don't worry."</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.60" dur="00:00:02.40">"I've been doing this for 53 years."</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.10" dur="00:00:02.50">"I took the exam in 1949 and passed."</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.30" dur="00:00:02.50">"This is my fugu chef license."</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.95" dur="00:00:03.50">After World War II, many people died from eating fugu.</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.80" dur="00:00:05.40">Many Japanese people were very hungry, and some looked for food in restaurant trash cans.</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.70" dur="00:00:02.50">Sometimes these people found pieces of fugu.</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.50" dur="00:00:03.00">They cooked the fugu and some of them died.</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.50" dur="00:00:02.00">It was a serious problem.</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.35" dur="00:00:04.00">So, American General Douglas MacArthur, who led the U.S. forces in Japan,</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.40" dur="00:00:01.80">introduced a test.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.65" dur="00:00:03.00">The fugu chefs had to take the test and get a license.</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.85" dur="00:00:04.90">Chef Hayashi took the test in 1949 and he still has his license.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.40" dur="00:00:06.90">Nevertheless, fugu killed 2,500 Japanese people between 1945 and 1975.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.20" dur="00:00:03.30">"About 70 percent of the poisonings happen in private homes</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.50" dur="00:00:03.25">where people catch and prepare fugu on their own and get poisoned."</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.45" dur="00:00:01.20">"That's most common."</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.75" dur="00:00:05.50">At the Tokyo University of Fisheries, Nagashima Tuji studies fugu poison carefully.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.85" dur="00:00:03.40">He hopes to develop an anti-toxin, which is a medicine that will</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.55" dur="00:00:02.40">stop people from dying because of fugu poisoning.</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.70" dur="00:00:03.30">"A tiger fugu has enough toxin to kill 30 people."</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.65" dur="00:00:06.00">"The toxin itself, to give you an idea, is 1,000 times stronger than cyanide."</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.45" dur="00:00:02.40">Fugu toxin is a very strong poison.</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.55" dur="00:00:03.60">In fact, one milligram of the toxin is strong enough to kill a person.</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.05" dur="00:00:02.10">It kills by paralyzing people's nerves.</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.85" dur="00:00:03.00">This means that the person who has been poisoned can't move.</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.85" dur="00:00:03.70">It also paralyzes the lungs so that the person can't breathe.</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.25" dur="00:00:02.20">Back in the Matsumoto restaurant kitchen,</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.60" dur="00:00:03.20">Chef Hayashi is preparing the fugu for Tom and Aki.</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.80" dur="00:00:02.00">"These are the gills. They're poison."</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.30" dur="00:00:04.50">Chef Hayashi carefully cuts away the poisonous parts of the fish and throws them out.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.00" dur="00:00:02.40">Then, he cuts the remaining flesh very thinly.</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.40" dur="00:00:04.60">Finally, he places the fugu on a plate and puts it in the shape of a chrysanthemum.</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.80" dur="00:00:03.10">The chrysanthemum is a beautiful flower that's popular in Japan.</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.90" dur="00:00:03.60">At the table, Aki and Tom are ready to try the fugu.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.10" dur="00:00:01.00">"Still breathing?"</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.20" dur="00:00:01.20">"I can still breathe!"</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.50" dur="00:00:02.60">A fugu meal is usually eight different dishes.</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.00" dur="00:00:02.90">These dishes feature fugu that is prepared in different ways.</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.10" dur="00:00:01.10">"And I still feel fine."</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.20" dur="00:00:03.40">Tom's favorite course is the grilled fugu, and Aki agrees.</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.70" dur="00:00:02.00">At the end of the meal, Tom smiles;</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.80" dur="00:00:03.20">he's happy that he's still healthy and breathing.</p>
