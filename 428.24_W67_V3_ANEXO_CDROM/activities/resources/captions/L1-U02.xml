<p begin="00:00:01.30" dur="00:00:02.50">Welcome to the beautiful islands of Hawaii.</p>  
<p begin="00:00:04.00" dur="00:00:02.00">Hawaii is a land of legends.</p> 
<p begin="00:00:06.50" dur="00:00:03.50">There is a very old legend about a dance called the hula.</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.05" dur="00:00:03.30">The hula started about 300 years ago. </p> 
<p begin="00:00:15.00" dur="00:00:02.85">A hula teacher tells us about the legend. </p>  
<p begin="00:00:18.35" dur="00:00:05.00">In the legend, a girl called Hi’iaki and her friend Hopoe go to the beach one day.</p>  
<p begin="00:00:23.35" dur="00:00:04.00">They look at the sea and the waves and they start to copy the waves.</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.35" dur="00:00:04.00">They move their hands like the waves and they move their bodies like the waves.</p>  
<p begin="00:00:31.45" dur="00:00:02.65">This is the start of the hula dance.</p>  
<p begin="00:00:35.20" dur="00:00:04.10">Then in 1820, missionaries from Western countries came to Hawaii.</p>   
<p begin="00:00:39.90" dur="00:00:04.50">They were surprised by the hula—the dancers did not wear many clothes!</p>  
<p begin="00:00:45.70" dur="00:00:05.25">The missionaries were so surprised, that they asked the queen of Hawaii to stop the dance.</p>  
<p begin="00:00:51.65" dur="00:00:04.90">After that, most Hawaiians were not allowed to dance the hula for almost sixty years.</p>  
<p begin="00:00:57.10" dur="00:00:03.40">But the Hawaiians still danced the hula but in secret.</p>  
<p begin="00:01:02.60" dur="00:00:02.70">Today, there is a new interest in Hawaiian culture.</p>  
<p begin="00:01:05.60" dur="00:00:03.20">People want to study the culture and learn how to dance the hula.</p>  
<p begin="00:01:09.70" dur="00:00:02.50">More and more people go to "halaus".</p> 
<p begin="00:01:12.50" dur="00:00:03.20">"Halaus" are schools that teach the dance in the traditional way.</p> 
<p begin="00:01:18.10" dur="00:00:02.80">The dancers have to work very hard to learn the dance.</p>   
<p begin="00:01:21.20" dur="00:00:04.00">They have to practice for many hours before they can dance the hula for other people.</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.10" dur="00:00:02.40">Kumano Palini Kulala is a hula teacher.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.10" dur="00:00:04.80">For him, the dance is a way of bringing the best of ancient Hawaiian culture to people today.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.60" dur="00:00:03.20">"...the hula is more...not so much a physical thing,</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.10" dur="00:00:02.50">but more of a mental and a spiritual thing."</p>   
<p begin="00:01:43.20" dur="00:00:06.40">"For them the dancing means very little because for Hawaiians today, many of them don’t speak the language."</p>  
<p begin="00:01:49.90" dur="00:00:05.80">"So, what I try to do is to bring to mind the reality that they see today."</p> 
<p begin="00:01:56.10" dur="00:00:03.50">Every year, there is a hula competition in Hilo, Hawaii.</p>  
<p begin="00:02:00.15" dur="00:00:03.50">Dancers from all the Hawaiian Islands come to the festival.</p> 
<p begin="00:02:05.65" dur="00:00:03.00">In the competition, judges look at more than just the dance.</p> 
<p begin="00:02:08.95" dur="00:00:02.90">They also look at the dancers’ costumes and style...</p>   
<p begin="00:02:11.95" dur="00:00:04.00">the way the person wears a skirt, the color of their costume, even their flowers.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.25" dur="00:00:03.90">Today in Hawaii, the hula is once again part of everyday life.</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.85" dur="00:00:05.00">Many people hope that this will save one of Hawaii’s most ancient traditions for the future.</p>
