<p begin="00:00:13.10" dur="00:00:05.65">Around the world there are many unusual sports but cheese rolling is one of the most unusual.</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.70" dur="00:00:04.85">Cheese rolling started about 200 years ago in the English town of Brockworth.</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.00" dur="00:00:03.90">First, the competitors come together at the top of Cooper’s Hill.</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.00" dur="00:00:04.30">Then someone pushes a very large wheel of cheese down the hill.</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.31" dur="00:00:01.00">And after that? </p>
<p begin="00:00:36.55" dur="00:00:01.50">The competitors run after it!</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.55" dur="00:00:03.60">The cheese rolls down the hill at more than 60 kilometers per hour.</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.75" dur="00:00:01.70">The competitors go pretty fast, too!</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.50" dur="00:00:02.00">The first person to arrive at the bottom wins.</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.00" dur="00:00:01.00">What’s the prize? </p>
<p begin="00:00:50.00" dur="00:00:01.60">The wheel of cheese—of course!</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.30" dur="00:00:02.80">The first winner of the day is Craig Brown, a pub worker.</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.80" dur="00:00:02.00">Craig’s plan was simple.</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.00" dur="00:00:02.00">"Keep going...and try to get your balance back because</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.30" dur="00:00:01.60">it’s steeper than you could ever think."</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.05" dur="00:00:02.20">"You would have to run down there to really believe how steep it is!"</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.10" dur="00:00:04.40">Many people enjoy the cheese rolling races, however they can be dangerous.</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.60" dur="00:00:03.80">A few years ago, 30 people were injured in an accident at a race.</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.40" dur="00:00:03.30">One of the cheeses rolled down the hill and went into the spectators.</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.00" dur="00:00:03.50">It's not just spectators who get injured, competitors do as well…</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.70" dur="00:00:03.20">especially when it's cold or there hasn't been much rain.</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.20" dur="00:00:01.70">"It's when the ground is really hard…</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.05" dur="00:00:01.90">that's when the injuries are going to happen."</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.15" dur="00:00:01.70">So, why do people enter the race?</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.70" dur="00:00:01.20">Are they crazy?</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.05" dur="00:00:01.80">One cheese runner thinks they may be.</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.85" dur="00:00:01.00">"It is dangerous."</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.00" dur="00:00:03.50">"If I’m running down...</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.75" dur="00:00:01.50">must be crazy."</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.70" dur="00:00:01.90">"Yeah, I must be crazy….”</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.20" dur="00:00:02.50">These cheese racers may be crazy.</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.90" dur="00:00:02.40">But every year the crowds keep on cheering,</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.40" dur="00:00:01.80">and the competitors keep on running.</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.20" dur="00:00:01.30">Is it for the fame?</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.65" dur="00:00:01.10">Is it for the fun?</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.85" dur="00:00:01.20">We may never know, </p>
<p begin="00:02:03.15" dur="00:00:05.40">but it’s more than just cheese that makes people want to win Brockworth’s annual cheese rolling race!</p>
