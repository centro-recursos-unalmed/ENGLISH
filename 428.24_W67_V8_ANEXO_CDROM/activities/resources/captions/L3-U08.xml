<p begin="00:00:01.50" dur="00:00:03.00">The Rodeo is truly an American original.</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.80" dur="00:00:04.30">Cowboys in Stetson hats and jeans riding bulls and roping steers.</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.50" dur="00:00:04.00">Because of the danger involved, it's usually thought of as a man's sport.</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.70" dur="00:00:03.50">But that's not true: there are cowgirls and they're going</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.20" dur="00:00:03.50">head-to-head with cowboys in some of the most dangerous competitions.</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.80" dur="00:00:03.00">"The raccoons have been in the hay..."</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.00" dur="00:00:03.00">It's traditionally thought of as a man's world.</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.00" dur="00:00:05.00">But truth be told, cowgirls have been in the saddle since the West was won.</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.00" dur="00:00:01.30">"Hoah cattle hoah."</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.10" dur="00:00:02.50">Meet Debbie Garrison and Pam Midek.</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.30" dur="00:00:04.00">They're modern cowgirls carrying on the ways of the Wild West.</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.60" dur="00:00:01.20">"Hoah cattle."</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.80" dur="00:00:04.20">"As you look at the history of the pioneers of the American West,</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.20" dur="00:00:02.30">I think the women were the hardest workers on the ranch."</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.00" dur="00:00:04.80">"A lot of times the husband was off doing things that he had to do and the women</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.80" dur="00:00:03.40">were left at home with the kids and take care of everything there."</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.20" dur="00:00:03.00">"But there was also stock and women had to get out and</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.20" dur="00:00:03.00">if a calf was sick or a cow was down or whatever."</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.20" dur="00:00:04.30">"I mean it was up to the wife to go out and the kids to go out</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.60" dur="00:00:02.20">and take care of that while the husband was gone."</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.00" dur="00:00:02.50">Pam and Debbie were riding before they could walk.</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.90" dur="00:00:03.80">Their careers took off when they were crowned Miss Rodeo America.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.10" dur="00:00:03.90">Pam in 1973 and Debbie in 1979.</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.00" dur="00:00:02.40">Today they're still running down steers.</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.00" dur="00:00:03.00">Team roping is one of the few events in professional rodeo</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.00" dur="00:00:02.60">where women compete head-to-head with men.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.40" dur="00:00:07.60">"I can swing a rope just as fast, and I can deliver it with just as much, I guess fierceness as a man can."</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.30" dur="00:00:06.20">With just seconds to tie horns and legs, team roping is about speed, precision and strength.</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.50" dur="00:00:02.50">Sometimes that's a dangerous combination.</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.00" dur="00:00:03.70">"Within the first two years that I roped, I cut a finger off."</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.00" dur="00:00:03.00">"My husband picked it up, I got off my horse,</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.00" dur="00:00:03.50">put my finger above my head so it wouldn't bleed too bad."</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.50" dur="00:00:04.00">"They took me to the hospital and seven hours later they reattached my finger."</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.00" dur="00:00:04.50">Welcome to Fort Worth, Texas where the rodeo is a true original.</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.50" dur="00:00:02.30">Bull riding is the most popular event.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.00" dur="00:00:05.50">It was considered too brutal for women in the past... but times are changing.</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.80" dur="00:00:04.20">DeDee Crawford was the 2001 world champion female bull rider.</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.00" dur="00:00:05.20">In a sport where broken bones, ruptured organs and trampled bodies are an everyday occurrence,</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.20" dur="00:00:04.80">DeDee takes pride in being a member of a small but elite group of intrepid women.</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.50" dur="00:00:03.50">"See, a lot of times I like to show up when the guys are like 'There ain't no way she's gonna ride.'"</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.00" dur="00:00:04.00">"I like to go out there and do my best and show them I can ride because they think I can't."</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.30" dur="00:00:03.70">"You've got to keep your head up and say 'I'm just as good as you all are.'"</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.70" dur="00:00:05.30">Barely 100 pounds, DeDee Crawford has been riding bulls since she was 5 years old.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.80" dur="00:00:02.40">"When you nod your head, they're gonna open that gate."</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.20" dur="00:00:03.60">"And that animal is out and whatever happens then is up to you and that animal, you know."</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.80" dur="00:00:03.70">"If the whistle blows, you step off and hope he don't run over you."</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.50" dur="00:00:03.00">"But if he does, he does, that's part of the game."</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.50" dur="00:00:04.70">The premise is simple: you hold onto the bull with one hand for 8 seconds.</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.00" dur="00:00:02.30">It seems like an eternity.</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.70" dur="00:00:01.60">"Ready to ride this sucker?"</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.30" dur="00:00:01.00">"I love it."</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.30" dur="00:00:03.80">"There's nothing more in the world that I don't love anymore. It's just rodeo."</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.70" dur="00:00:03.00">"It's fixin' to run over you and kick you, and stomp you,</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.70" dur="00:00:02.30">but you know if you love it you love it. Do it."</p>
