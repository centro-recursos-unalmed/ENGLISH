<p begin="00:00:03.70" dur="00:00:06.00">Long ago, England was a land of country houses, palaces, gardens, and afternoon tea.</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.82" dur="00:00:04.00">Every real gentleman had servants, especially a butler.</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.83" dur="00:00:04.00">Just 70 years ago, there were tens of thousands of butlers in England,</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.85" dur="00:00:01.70">now there are only a few.</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.77" dur="00:00:03.00">So where does one find a good butler nowadays?</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.90" dur="00:00:04.90">The Ivor Spencer International School for Butler Administrators—of course!</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.90" dur="00:00:03.15">"Good evening, sir. My name is Michael. I'm your butler."</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.10" dur="00:00:01.30">"My name is Jose."</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.69" dur="00:00:00.50">"I'm your butler."</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.59" dur="00:00:01.30">"Can I bring you some refreshments, sir?"</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.30" dur="00:00:00.52">"I'm your butler."</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.68" dur="00:00:02.00">"Good evening, sir."</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.20" dur="00:00:03.60">It's the first day of class and the students are learning how to introduce</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.83" dur="00:00:03.00">themselves to their 'gentleman' or 'lady.'</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.72" dur="00:00:03.50">A proper butler must also learn to carry himself correctly.</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.00" dur="00:00:02.50">"There goes Mr. Windings."</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.89" dur="00:00:01.50">"Your champagne, my lady."</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.85" dur="00:00:01.70">"Your champagne, my lady."</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.30" dur="00:00:01.40">"No problem, sir."</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.10" dur="00:00:01.50">"No problem, sir."</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.82" dur="00:00:03.00">"Butlers? I haven't seen a butler for a long time."</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.90" dur="00:00:04.00">Seventy years ago, there were an estimated 30,000 butlers.</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.10" dur="00:00:02.50">Today there are fewer than 200.</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.70" dur="00:00:04.30">But if Ivor Spencer has anything to say about it, that's going to change!</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.68" dur="00:00:01.40">"It's a pleasure, sir."</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.10" dur="00:00:01.40">"No problem, sir!"</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.90" dur="00:00:01.50">"No problem, sir!"</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.40" dur="00:00:01.60">"I'll fetch it immediately, sir."</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.40" dur="00:00:01.60">"I'll fetch it immediately, sir."</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.10" dur="00:00:04.70">Ivor Spencer wants to use his school to bring back the butler to this land of tradition.</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.90" dur="00:00:03.80">"Good morning, everybody. Welcome to the Ivor Spencer School.</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.30" dur="00:00:03.50">We know you've come from all over the world and we appreciate you being here."</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.10" dur="00:00:01.50">"Good morning, your Excellency."</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.90" dur="00:00:03.40">Future butlers must learn how to use the correct titles to</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.34" dur="00:00:03.35">refer to ambassadors, kings, queens, and lords!</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.79" dur="00:00:04.90">Over the next five weeks, 13 international students will have 86 lessons</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.74" dur="00:00:02.10">in the art of being a butler.</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.95" dur="00:00:03.50">If they succeed, they may work for a businessman, an important leader,</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.50" dur="00:00:01.20">or even a king.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.77" dur="00:00:01.57">But, first, they have to graduate.</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.75" dur="00:00:04.70">Mr. Spencer says that some people can't even last longer than the first few days.</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.73" dur="00:00:05.70">"On every course there are about two people that don't make it past the first two days."</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.00" dur="00:00:03.70">This may come true for one student in the new group, David Marceau.</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.95" dur="00:00:02.00">"Good morning, the Lee residence."</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.00" dur="00:00:03.40">"Practice makes perfect so hopefully, with a lot of practice,</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.50" dur="00:00:02.50">I'll be just as good as any other butler out there."</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.78" dur="00:00:03.00">"I just hope I'm going to be right for the job and hope I can do it."</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.20" dur="00:00:05.40">It's important for students to keep their hopes up and practice, practice, practice!</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.76" dur="00:00:02.00">"It's a pleasure, sir."</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.92" dur="00:00:05.90">The word 'butler' comes from the French word 'bouteillier,' which means 'bottle carrier.'</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.95" dur="00:00:03.00">For new butlers, this can be difficult.</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.95" dur="00:00:01.40">"No problem, sir."</p>

<p begin="00:02:49.80" dur="00:00:01.40">"No problem, sir."</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.00" dur="00:00:01.70">"It's a pleasure, sir."</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.00" dur="00:00:02.20">"No problem, sir."</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.70" dur="00:00:02.00">"No problem, sir."</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.74" dur="00:00:01.40">"Your champagne, my lady."</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.70" dur="00:00:02.00">"Your champagne, my lady."</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.00" dur="00:00:02.90">Things go better for everyone this time.</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.95" dur="00:00:03.00">It seems that all the practice is showing some results.</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.00" dur="00:00:02.50">Even David Marceau is showing improvement.</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.78" dur="00:00:02.00">"Your champagne, my lord."</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.10" dur="00:00:02.30">"It's on the floor, my lord."</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.71" dur="00:00:00.90">"Good evening, sir."</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.81" dur="00:00:01.00">"Good evening, sir."</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.85" dur="00:00:01.00">"Good evening, sir."</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.95" dur="00:00:05.50">By the third week, students start to find out if they really can become butlers or not.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.71" dur="00:00:01.50">"I'm your butler."</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.83" dur="00:00:02.00">"Good evening, sir."</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.20" dur="00:00:01.00">"Go back."</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.75" dur="00:00:05.50">"It's very difficult here. It's very difficult. The course isn't easy at all."</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.84" dur="00:00:01.00">"Good evening, sir."</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.86" dur="00:00:01.00">"Evening."</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.90" dur="00:00:02.50">"My name is David. And I am your butler."</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.73" dur="00:00:02.80">"May I offer you some...May I offer you some..."</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.60" dur="00:00:01.10">"Do that again, David."</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.15" dur="00:00:02.80">"I have some problems and I have to deal with them."</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.69" dur="00:00:01.50">"Good evening, sir..."</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.30" dur="00:00:02.50">David is not just having difficulty with the course;</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.40" dur="00:00:02.80">he also misses his friends and family back home.</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.40" dur="00:00:04.20">"I miss my girlfriend very much. She's giving me support on the phone."</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.71" dur="00:00:04.30">"I just talked to her last night. Things are okay and everything."</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.79" dur="00:00:02.00">"Yes, I wish I was there right now."</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.10" dur="00:00:03.50">There are a lot of secrets to being a good butler.</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.80" dur="00:00:02.75">For example, did you know that you can iron a newspaper to make it</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.60" dur="00:00:02.80">look nice and avoid leaving ink everywhere?</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.79" dur="00:00:04.00">Ivor Spencer does, and he teaches the class how to do it.</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.69" dur="00:00:03.00">"That's probably the only time the butler has...</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.78" dur="00:00:02.00">to read the newspaper."</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.74" dur="00:00:06.00">"If you see a burnt newspaper, you know that the butler's been very interested."</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.95" dur="00:00:03.50">Sometimes butlers need other unusual skills.</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.50" dur="00:00:04.00">For example, they might need to deal with unwelcome guests.</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.72" dur="00:00:02.50">These butlers will be ready.</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.88" dur="00:00:06.00">Butlers must also learn how to recognize quality products, or 'the finer things in life.'</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.95" dur="00:00:01.70">From the best tobacco pipes...</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.75" dur="00:00:01.50">"It's not just a piece of wood."</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.30" dur="00:00:02.00">"It's a piece of art."</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.60" dur="00:00:02.00">to expensive shoes...</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.88" dur="00:00:01.50">to, of course...</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.50" dur="00:00:02.20">"Welcome to the house of Moet et Chandon."</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.00" dur="00:00:01.50">...champagne.</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.75" dur="00:00:01.00">"Sante...</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.94" dur="00:00:02.00">to champagne."</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.73" dur="00:00:02.00">Graduation day arrives.</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.86" dur="00:00:03.50">"David, you've come a long way. We appreciate it."</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.39" dur="00:00:03.50">Everyone gets their certificates—even David.</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.95" dur="00:00:02.30">After, the students have a small party.</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.30" dur="00:00:02.00">"Good health everybody."</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.40" dur="00:00:01.50">"I did it!"</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.71" dur="00:00:03.70">Before they came here, these young men and women drove buses,</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.69" dur="00:00:03.50">worked with computers, or worked in restaurants or stores.</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.25" dur="00:00:03.25">Now they are part of a very old English tradition.</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.74" dur="00:00:05.00">The Ivor Spencer School for Butler Administrators has done its job well!</p>
