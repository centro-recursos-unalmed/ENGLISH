<p begin="00:00:01.80" dur="00:00:07.20">The Islands of Hawaii have become a familiar paradise, but ancient Polynesians had to use the stars to find them, </p>
<p begin="00:00:09.30" dur="00:00:04.40">and it is the stars that bring a new breed of explorers here now.</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.70" dur="00:00:07.50">The highest point of these tropical islands is a frigid Alpine desert which may be the best astronomical site in the world. </p>
<p begin="00:00:22.50" dur="00:00:06.00">The Earth’s highest volcano, Mauna Kea, stands above city lights and industrial pollution. </p>
<p begin="00:00:28.80" dur="00:00:04.40">So, other worldly, astronauts trained here to walk on the moon!</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.50" dur="00:00:04.00">Professional astronomers consider this mountain their Mecca. </p>
<p begin="00:00:37.90" dur="00:00:06.80">This month’s star attraction: Comet Halley, a lofty cloud of ice and dust some nine miles long. </p>
<p begin="00:00:45.00" dur="00:00:05.00">"I think the amateur astronomers and the professional astronomers share a lot of the same enthusiasm over</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.00" dur="00:00:04.00">something as exciting as a comet, and in particular, a comet as famous as this one."</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.00" dur="00:00:04.40">"We all enjoy looking at it, taking pictures of it, trying to understand more about it,</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.40" dur="00:00:05.10">and enjoying the whole nighttime sky that we’ll soon have available to us here in a few minutes."</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.50" dur="00:00:04.00">Minutes are inconsequential measures against the 76 year wait </p>
<p begin="00:01:09.50" dur="00:00:04.50">between Halley’s appearances or the comet’s four billion year past.</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.30" dur="00:00:04.20">As a once-in-a-lifetime novelty, it creates a special excitement.</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.00" dur="00:00:03.30">"Oh, this is...These are heavy binoculars."</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.00" dur="00:00:03.20">"It’s something that you want to be able to experience."</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.20" dur="00:00:04.00">"Even for those of us who don’t do much in comet watching or star gazing."</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.20" dur="00:00:02.50">"I have trouble finding the Big Dipper in the sky."</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.10" dur="00:00:05.10">"But I just love the idea of being able to see something that I...you know, once."</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.30" dur="00:00:08.10">"I think that people do expect to be able to walk out and see this big bright object in the sky and without searching very hard."</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.00" dur="00:00:04.00">"I think people expect to see the comet in the sky and see it moving."</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.40" dur="00:00:03.20">"The pictures that you see published show a big long tail which</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.00" dur="00:00:03.30">makes it look like it’s flying through the atmosphere and spewing off this tail."</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.50" dur="00:00:05.00">"And although that’s what it looks like, the object is really millions of miles away." </p>
<p begin="00:02:07.20" dur="00:00:03.30">"The tail is being caused by the solar wind."</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.30" dur="00:00:08.00">Renowned astronomers come here, willing to endure the cold and the thin air for what they call 'the best seeing in the world.'</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.50" dur="00:00:03.00">The top of Mauna Kea reaches halfway to outer space.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.10" dur="00:00:05.00">Its gigantic multi-million dollar eyes take astronomers the rest of the way there. </p>
<p begin="00:02:33.00" dur="00:00:06.50">These telescopes require intensive care. Refrigerated domes keep temperatures constant inside and out.</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.05" dur="00:00:02.30">Any variation distorts the images.</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.00" dur="00:00:07.20">With its tin can housing, the 24-inch telescope is less sophisticated than its state-of-the-art neighbors,</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.00" dur="00:00:03.40">but as the eye for a special camera it makes an important contribution.</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.50" dur="00:00:07.00">"We have to insure that the telescope tracks very accurately on the comet during this half-hour exposure."</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.40" dur="00:00:03.50">"It's hard to imagine anything much more exciting than a comet that makes a quick pass through the solar system."</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.00" dur="00:00:05.20">"What this camera, with its photographic film does is take a very wide-angle picture of the sky."</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.00" dur="00:00:04.00">"We have electronic detectors that make excellent images of small spots in the sky,</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.00" dur="00:00:03.20">but when you want to study something that’s very large,</p>
<p begin="00:3:28.85" dur="00:00:04.50">such as the comet tail, then the photography is still really the best way to do it."</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.50" dur="00:00:05.00">Making several half-hour exposures a night, Cruikshank observes changes in the comet’s tail,</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.50" dur="00:00:04.00">a luminous streamer stretching ten million miles from the core,</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.50" dur="00:00:04.00">the equivalent of a toy marble leaving a ten-mile trail.</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.85" dur="00:00:03.50">While most of us consider star-gazing a night time activity, </p>
<p begin="00:03:55.80" dur="00:00:05.00">at two of Mauna Kea’s telescopes, observations continue 24 hours a day. </p>
<p begin="00:04:02.00" dur="00:00:06.30">At NASA’s infrared facility, astronomers can collect data from wavelengths unseen by the human eye.</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.10" dur="00:00:05.30">In the infrared, it’s possible to tell the temperatures of distant objects and to identify their composition.</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.35" dur="00:00:07.10">Aimed at Halley, this telescope’s data suggest that the comet is made of many things which make up our own atmosphere: </p>
<p begin="00:04:23.00" dur="00:00:03.40">water, methane, carbon, oxygen, and ammonia.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.35" dur="00:00:04.30">Relentless scrutiny by earthbound telescopes has given scientists a great deal of information</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.35" dur="00:00:02.00">about what they call the 'cosmic refrigerator.'</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.00" dur="00:00:05.00">But to confirm their theories, astronomers have taken their vision to space.</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.00" dur="00:00:07.00">Two Japanese spacecraft took pictures of the glowing hydrogen atoms surrounding the comet and measured solar winds.</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.30" dur="00:00:04.00">Both traveled at least 89,000 miles from the core. </p>
<p begin="00:04:52.00" dur="00:00:04.00">The Soviets sent Vega I and II within 5100 miles of Halley.</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.30" dur="00:00:05.00">Though both were damaged by clouds of dust smashing them at 150,000 miles an hour,</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.00" dur="00:00:03.00">they successfully recorded the closest glimpses of the comet ever,</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.40" dur="00:00:05.00">confirming that it has a solid core and that it is some nine miles across.</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.40" dur="00:00:07.00">A few dubbed the probe, which ventured within 350 miles of the nucleus, Kamikaze,</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.40" dur="00:00:04.20">but Giotto survived and revealed some startling facts.</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.00" dur="00:00:07.40">Dust jets burst with unexplained force from conical vents on the comet, and its surface is a velvet black.</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.50" dur="00:00:07.00">It is certain that scientists will learn more from this appearance of the comet than in all previous observations combined.</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.95" dur="00:00:05.00">"There’s a lot of romance and even drama standing here in the cold looking at the stars."</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.35" dur="00:00:04.00">"Either through a telescope like I’m doing now or just whenever there are a few extra moments</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.35" dur="00:00:03.20">--just looking at the star field outside the dome."</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.00" dur="00:00:06.00">"The stars that most people never get to see, because they're glued to their TV sets and their nice well-lit rooms</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.05" dur="00:00:03.00">and in their well-lit cities, are a constant source of beauty."</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.50" dur="00:00:05.00">"A source of beauty that most of us miss these days. It’s a kind of communion with nature."</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.00" dur="00:00:06.20">"And I think that, that always helps us understand more about ourselves as well as the world we live in."</p>
