<p begin="00:00:03.65" dur="00:00:03.65">The beautiful rolling countryside of England has a long history.</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.65" dur="00:00:04.15">But in recent years, there's been a strange phenomenon here; one which people</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.90" dur="00:00:02.75">all over the world have been studying with great interest...</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.35" dur="00:00:01.40">crop circles.</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.00" dur="00:00:04.90">These strange and mysterious circles have many people—even some scientists asking</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.00" dur="00:00:02.15">—who or what could have made them?</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.50" dur="00:00:04.25">Since the beginning of time, human beings have created signs such as unusual</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.85" dur="00:00:03.40">constructions or animals carved into the hillsides.</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.45" dur="00:00:03.30">Some people suggest that different cultures may have constructed them as</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.15" dur="00:00:01.40">ways of communicating with aliens.</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.10" dur="00:00:03.40">Others say that ancient peoples must have created them to please the gods.</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.05" dur="00:00:02.95">Did people create these crop circles or are they messages made</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.35" dur="00:00:02.25">by aliens from outer space?</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.90" dur="00:00:02.00">The question has been the cause of much debate.</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.50" dur="00:00:04.10">"I walked into the first crop circle in 1990, and I thought,</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.70" dur="00:00:03.15">'Hmm... I love puzzles.'"</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.00" dur="00:00:05.40">"And what I did was say, 'Right, I'm going to try and find out what this puzzle's all about.'"</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.80" dur="00:00:03.50">"I think probably ninety-five percent of them are man-made."</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.10" dur="00:00:06.65">"But there's one particularly here, just over on the hill—Milk Hill—it's so enormous,</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.85" dur="00:00:03.20">that you can't even see the other side of the crop formation."</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.90" dur="00:00:03.60">Presley then explains that the formation is over a kilometer wide.</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.80" dur="00:00:03.15">He feels that people couldn't have made such an enormous circle without</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.05" dur="00:00:02.00">other people knowing about it.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.30" dur="00:00:03.30">He also points out that these formations appear all over the world.</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.85" dur="00:00:03.00">He tells of a circle in a forest near Vancouver, Canada.</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.40" dur="00:00:03.50">In it, only the top two meters of the trees were bent and shaped in a circle.</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.80" dur="00:00:03.10">Remarkably, the trees were not broken suddenly and quickly,</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.00" dur="00:00:03.00">but bent over—without breaking—when they were arranged.</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.85" dur="00:00:04.50">Presley has also heard of ice circles, in which a circle of ice is missing from a body of</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.50" dur="00:00:02.50">water while the area around it remains frozen.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.00" dur="00:00:04.30">For Presley, a connection between these mysterious circles almost certainly exists,</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.85" dur="00:00:03.50">but to a young Englishman named Matthew, they're not all that mysterious.</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.80" dur="00:00:03.00">"Yeah, a lot of circles have been appearing in this area."</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.10" dur="00:00:05.30">"It's a lovely landscape, and the fields are just very clean and open like a canvas."</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.95" dur="00:00:03.85">In the area near Matthew's home, many crop circles have recently appeared.</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.95" dur="00:00:02.00">While he will not admit to making any of these,</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.10" dur="00:00:03.55">Matthew has offered to demonstrate exactly how crop circles are made.</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.00" dur="00:00:04.75">"Well, if there are aliens out there doing it, they're using stomper boards and...</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.15" dur="00:00:02.05">these little markers."</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.30" dur="00:00:03.75">"Because, I mean, there's things there, like combing effects, which are people going</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.05" dur="00:00:02.35">around and around and around the same area, flattening it down."</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.55" dur="00:00:01.65">"That wouldn't be there with aliens I'm sure."</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.80" dur="00:00:05.00">In fact, Matthew thinks aliens would more likely use a faster, instantaneous technique;</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.00" dur="00:00:02.40">something obviously real to everyone—even him.</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.95" dur="00:00:02.30">Matthew's never seen this kind of evidence.</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.75" dur="00:00:03.00">The only crop circles he's seen are undoubtedly made by humans.</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.80" dur="00:00:03.70">As Matthew and his team begin the long evening task of making a crop circle,</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.85" dur="00:00:02.45">he talks about some of the beliefs regarding them.</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.55" dur="00:00:04.50">He explains how people imagine seeing extraterrestrials, strange balls of light,</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.50" dur="00:00:02.25">or UFOs when they see a crop circle.</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.55" dur="00:00:02.90">Matthew, however, claims that crop circle design is actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.55" dur="00:00:02.40">a creative art done by human beings.</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.45" dur="00:00:04.40">He also explains that teams sometimes challenge each other to amaze the public by</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.95" dur="00:00:02.20">showing what they can do in an evening.</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.45" dur="00:00:02.00">"It is a bit like a military operation."</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.95" dur="00:00:03.40">"You've got to get in, do the job, get out, not get caught, you know."</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.95" dur="00:00:01.00">"It's SAS I suppose."</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.05" dur="00:00:00.75">"Who dares wins."</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.35" dur="00:00:03.35">"I'm a little bit worried about some of the beliefs I hear going around."</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.00" dur="00:00:02.00">"Some of the stuff is a bit apocalyptic."</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.15" dur="00:00:04.00">At times, Matthew is disturbed by some of the beliefs about crop circles.</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.25" dur="00:00:04.50">He thinks that some people are using the circles to push their own unusual theories.</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.15" dur="00:00:02.20">In his years of making crop circles,</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.45" dur="00:00:02.70">Matthew's never seen any evidence that aliens made them.</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.35" dur="00:00:05.10">In his opinion, crop circles are definitely not signs of intelligent life in outer space; but</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.60" dur="00:00:04.50">perhaps opinions like Matthew's are a sign of one kind of intelligent life</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.30" dur="00:00:02.10">—intelligent life on Earth!</p>
