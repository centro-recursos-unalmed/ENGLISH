<p begin="00:00:07.00" dur="00:00:04.00">"Speed really thrills me, and that's what I like about it."</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.40" dur="00:00:04.00">"Speed, you have total freedom. You can do whatever you want."</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.40" dur="00:00:04.00">"It's like, no laws, no rules, you know nothing bothers you."</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.00" dur="00:00:03.50">"Me riding a bike is like a bird flying."</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.40" dur="00:00:04.00">Every day, in New York City, millions of people crowd the streets,</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.50" dur="00:00:02.20">along with more than a million cars.</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.00" dur="00:00:03.50">On a bad day, the traffic stops completely.</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.20" dur="00:00:03.30">Only bicycle messengers can speed across the city.</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.20" dur="00:00:04.60">In tiny offices all across the city are many bicycle messenger companies,</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.80" dur="00:00:02.50">like this one, called Light Speed.</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.50" dur="00:00:05.30">In Light Speed's office, dispatchers take calls and send messengers all around the city.</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.50" dur="00:00:04.00">The messengers race through traffic, any way they can.</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.50" dur="00:00:01.70">"Do they tell you the rules when you get hired?"</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.50" dur="00:00:03.00">"Oh yeah, I've known these rules since before I was even hired as a messenger."</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.80" dur="00:00:01.70">"You know not to go through red lights then, right?"</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.50" dur="00:00:00.50">"Mm-hm."</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.00" dur="00:00:02.00">"Then why do you go through the red lights?"</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.50" dur="00:00:01.00">"Speed."</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.50" dur="00:00:05.00">Messengers are paid for each message they deliver, so they never want to stop-</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.50" dur="00:00:01.50">or slow down.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.50" dur="00:00:02.20">This can lead to conflicts.</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.00" dur="00:00:03.50">"My comment is that they're dangerous. They can kill you."</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.00" dur="00:00:02.30">"They're only looking for cars, really."</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.30" dur="00:00:03.00">"And they'll be looking and you can look right in their eyes and say,</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.30" dur="00:00:03.80">'this man is looking at me, he knows I'm here, I'm going here' but they don't see you."</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.10" dur="00:00:03.20">"All they, they look through you, it's-you're transparent."</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.50" dur="00:00:05.70">"It's a very dangerous job because of the traffic and speed is of utmost importance</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.20" dur="00:00:04.80">because they're on strictly a commission basis and-I like them, personally."</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.00" dur="00:00:04.00">"They do a good job, and they get their job done, and they gotta make a dollar so... that's what counts."</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.20" dur="00:00:07.25">Businesses in New York depend on bicycle messengers because it's the only fast way to deliver things on city streets.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.50" dur="00:00:04.20">This company calls for a messenger 30 to 40 times a day.</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.50" dur="00:00:06.00">Most messengers carry only documents, but some will take more dangerous assignments.</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.70" dur="00:00:04.50">Despite the danger and difficulty, most bicycle messengers would</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.25" dur="00:00:04.30">never trade the speed and excitement for a more normal job.</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.00" dur="00:00:03.50">Their work keeps the businesses of New York moving.</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.30" dur="00:00:03.00">"Come on, get in the car, get the door!"</p>
