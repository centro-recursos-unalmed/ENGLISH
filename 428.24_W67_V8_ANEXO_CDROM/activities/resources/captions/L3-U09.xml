<p begin="00:00:14.50" dur="00:00:02.00">It isn't your typical workplace.</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.40" dur="00:00:03.30">Employees are asked to perform a variety of tasks.</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.30" dur="00:00:04.00">"Under certain conditions we'll also shoot a .22 pistol and a shotgun."</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.00" dur="00:00:03.40">Many of the people who work here are highly trained engineers.</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.70" dur="00:00:03.00">But instead of making things, they try to destroy them.</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.20" dur="00:00:02.20">"Are you ready? All right."</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.25" dur="00:00:05.30">The organization that causes all these accidents is a company called Underwriters Laboratories.</p>
<p begin="00:00:62.20" dur="00:00:05.40">It was started in 1894 to test the safety of everyday products.</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.45" dur="00:00:02.80">The tests take a variety of forms.</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.20" dur="00:00:02.60">Each year, thousands of home appliances are tested.</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.40" dur="00:00:06.05">Irons, toasters, blenders, and hair dryers are hit, dropped, crushed and broken.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.20" dur="00:00:03.20">This is to make them safe for people who don't use them carefully.</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.30" dur="00:00:03.00">"My children, when I go home and, you know, talk about work, they think thats really neat</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.30" dur="00:00:04.20">that Daddy goes off to work and gets to break tubes and break TVs and drop radios."</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.55" dur="00:00:02.35">These funny tests have a very serious purpose:</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.00" dur="00:00:02.20">to protect people from accidents that could happen.</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.40" dur="00:00:03.10">If children play baseball in front of a TV, for example.</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.05" dur="00:00:03.00">People have been breaking things at Underwriters Laboratories,</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.05" dur="00:00:04.00">for many, many years, using many of the same techniques.</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.20" dur="00:00:02.20">Each test answers a question:</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.40" dur="00:00:02.20">Can a thief open a bank safe?</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.40" dur="00:00:02.30">Will bulletproof glass really stop bullets?</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.50" dur="00:00:02.20">Some of the tests are simpler than others.</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.20" dur="00:00:02.30">"Even though we dont know all the uses a product may see, </p>
<p begin="00:02:53.50" dur="00:00:02.50">we do have some stock tests we run on hand-held appliances."</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.00" dur="00:00:02.10">"And one of those is the drop test."</p>
<p begin="00:02:61.40" dur="00:00:05.00">The engineers must predict all the ways people could use an appliance wrong. </p>
<p begin="00:03:07.40" dur="00:00:03.00">They start with the correct way to use it, and then </p>
<p begin="00:03:10.65" dur="00:00:03.35">try to think of all the mistakes people could make with it.</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.90" dur="00:00:06.00">At the end of the workday, UL employees collect the appliances from the days experiments.</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.00" dur="00:00:07.00">Moments later, they are crushed one more timeâ€”to make them into trash.</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.00" dur="00:00:06.50">It seems a fitting way to say goodbye to the place that employees sometimes call the Fun House.</p>
