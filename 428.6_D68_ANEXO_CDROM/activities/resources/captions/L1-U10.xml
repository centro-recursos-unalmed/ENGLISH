Home of the Pyramids, one of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world. Tourists from all over the world come to Egypt to visit these amazing structures.</p>    <p begin="00:00:19.50" dur="00:00:01.40">But some people are worried.</p>    <p begin="00:00:22.50" dur="00:00:10.80">"It's like a zoo. I mean the pyramids, which contain one of the seven wonders of the world - the only one that still exists - to be as though it's like a zoo... It's a crime."</p>    <p begin="00:00:34.30" dur="00:00:08.00">A zoo? For archaeologist Zahi Hawass, the problem is that around the pyramids there are camels and horses everywhere.</p>    <p begin="00:00:42.95" dur="00:00:09.75">There are also crowds of people competing to sell souvenirs to the tourists. It's difficult, he says, for ordinary visitors to feel how magical and mysterious the pyramids really are.</p>    <p begin="00:00:53.00" dur="00:00:05.45">Zahi Hawass is leader of the expert archaeological team responsible for maintaining the Giza pyramids.</p>    <p begin="00:00:59.00" dur="00:00:06.70">He plans to bring back the ancient wonder of the Pyramids...and protect them from the physical damage caused by tourism.</p>    <p begin="00:00:66.50" dur="00:00:04.75">He says if this task isn't done now, the pyramids could disappear in a hundred years.</p>    <p begin="00:00:72.10" dur="00:00:03.70">Giza is home to the most famous ancient monuments in the world...</p>    <p begin="00:00:76.45" dur="00:00:01.80">the great pyramid of Khufu... </p>    <p begin="00:00:79.70" dur="00:00:01.50">his son Khafre...  </p>    <p begin="00:00:81.70" dur="00:00:01.80">and grandson Menkaure.</p>    <p begin="00:00:84.50" dur="00:00:03.50">And watching over all three...the Great Sphinx.</p>    <p begin="00:00:91.70" dur="00:00:02.75">Egyptians are proud of these timeless monuments.</p>    <p begin="00:00:97.40" dur="00:00:05.70">But moving closer to the Pyramids are the houses of Cairo residents, approaching from all directions.</p>    <p begin="00:00:105.50" dur="00:00:05.25">According to Hawass, the houses seem to be 'attacking', almost killing, the pyramids.</p>    <p begin="00:00:113.10" dur="00:00:07.00">"I always say the pyramids can never be killed. Now it can be killed,"</p>    <p begin="00:00:124.60" dur="00:00:03.75">Giza is home not only to the pyramids, but more than four million people.</p>    <p begin="00:00:130.90" dur="00:00:08.25">It's a large, crowded suburb, an area just outside Cairo, with lots of noise and traffic.</p>    <p begin="00:00:142.50" dur="00:00:07.50">Even though officials can't just bring the buildings down, they can stop the city getting closer by building this...</p>    <p begin="00:00:151.25" dur="00:00:00.80">A wall...</p>    <p begin="00:00:154.40" dur="00:00:05.70">Hawass says the wall is designed primarily to control the number of people entering the Pyramids site.</p>    <p begin="00:00:161.70" dur="00:00:09.50">It's a wise development, he says. The role of the wall is to protect tourists from all the camels and horses, and to keep the area of the pyramids more peaceful.</p>    <p begin="00:00:171.90" dur="00:00:04.90">Visitors, as Hawass says, will now be able to feel the magic of the pyramids in their heart.</p>    <p begin="00:00:178.30" dur="00:00:04.35">The Giza project is also finding and protecting a number of ancient objects.</p>    <p begin="00:00:183.90" dur="00:00:05.80">Although not as famous as the giant pyramids, these smaller tombs are also being carefully protected.</p>    <p begin="00:00:192.50" dur="00:00:03.10">Laborers here are finding and working with the artifacts.</p>    <p begin="00:00:196.75" dur="00:00:08.35">One day, sites like this one will be open to tourists; this will take away traffic and stress from the three big pyramids and the Sphinx.</p>    <p begin="00:00:209.50" dur="00:00:07.25">Even after centuries of digging and discovering amazing monuments in Giza , the team are still making new discoveries.</p>    <p begin="00:00:218.00" dur="00:00:11.35">You never know, says Hawass, what secrets are here. He believes that, across the centuries, the kings of Egypt are saying thank you to today's Pyramid protectors.</p>   </div>  </body></tt>
