    <p begin="00:00:03.30" dur="00:00:05.00">At first, the activity looks familiar, like a traditional form of bungee jumping.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:9.00" dur="00:00:07.00">But after watching the first diver fall to the earth, it's clear that what's happening here on Pentecost Island is very different.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:20.10" dur="00:00:05.00">This is Naghol, an ancient religious event which means "land diving."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:26.00" dur="00:00:03.10">The diver's goal is to touch the earth with the top of his head.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:31.00" dur="00:00:04.40">The people believe this will make sure the earth produces lots of food this year.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:41.40" dur="00:00:08.00">The land divers jump from a 21-meter high tower, built in a space in the jungle. From here you can see the Pacific Ocean.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:51.00" dur="00:00:04.00">One of the event's organizers, Renee, gives this advice: </p>
    <p begin="00:00:55.40" dur="00:00:07.10">"Whenever you are on the tower ready to jump, if you have second thoughts that means you must not jump."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:64.00" dur="00:00:02.30">The first diver greets the people.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:72.00" dur="00:00:04.10">His dive goes well. He hits the ground hard, but he's okay.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:77.00" dur="00:00:03.00">His friends quickly free him from the vines that are tied to his feet.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:81.00" dur="00:00:02.00">The second dive doesn't go as well.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:83.40" dur="00:00:06.00">The young boys ask about the strength of the vines. But the older divers tell them that they will be strong enough.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:90.00" dur="00:00:03.00">But they aren't strong enough.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:94.00" dur="00:00:04.00">One of the vines breaks and the young boy goes face first into the earth.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:99.00" dur="00:00:05.00">Everyone goes to help him. But the boy doesn't speak; he's hurt.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:106.00" dur="00:00:08.10">The last time a land diver was killed here was in 1974. But people get hurt every year-sometimes seriously.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:116.00" dur="00:00:03.00">The other boys and men put cold water on the boy's head.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:124.00" dur="00:00:03.40">Eventually he walks away, assisted by friends and brothers.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:128.50" dur="00:00:02.00">One of the older men jumps next.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:131.00" dur="00:00:03.00">It's an especially good dive -- perfect!</p>
    <p begin="00:00:136.00" dur="00:00:05.00">People from abroad are not allowed to take part in land diving, as it's only for native divers.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:142.00" dur="00:00:05.00">But the chief says that a Western cameraman can tie a small camera to a diver's leg.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:147.20" dur="00:00:02.10">It's the first time this has been done.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:149.50" dur="00:00:04.00">The people love it. The cameraman thanks the land diver.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:155.40" dur="00:00:06.00">The young man who wore the camera on his dive tells about his jumps in the local language, Raga.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:162.00" dur="00:00:08.00">"The first dive was great. The second dive I broke a vine. But as long as I'm not hurt, everything is going well. I'm a lucky man."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:171.00" dur="00:00:07.00">The last dive of the afternoon is by one of the best divers on Pentecost Island. He's been diving for many years.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:180.00" dur="00:00:05.00">He dives from the tower and lands safely. Everyone is very happy.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:187.50" dur="00:00:03.00">When it's finished, the children run around the tower.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:191.00" dur="00:00:08.00">They dream of the day when they'll be old enough to dive, old enough to test their bravery in one of the most unusual events on earth.</p>
