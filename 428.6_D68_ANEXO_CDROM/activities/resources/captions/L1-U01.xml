    <p begin="00:00:02.50" dur="00:00:02.60">Monkeys are very intelligent animals.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:5.60" dur="00:00:03.70">In fact, some smart monkeys even go to college!</p>
    <p begin="00:00:10.00" dur="00:00:06.70">The monkeys at the Monkey Training School in Surat Thani, Thailand are sent there by farmers to learn an important job:</p>
    <p begin="00:00:17.30" dur="00:00:03.50">how to pick coconuts from very tall trees.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:21.50" dur="00:00:06.80">Trainer Somporn Saewkwo says it takes months for the young monkeys to learn the strategy for picking coconuts.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:28.50" dur="00:00:06.00">For the first month, he just lets the monkey play. He shows him how to spin a coconut in a box.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:35.00" dur="00:00:06.00">Then he holds the monkey's hand and encourages him to twist the coconut himself.</p>

    <p begin="00:00:42.00" dur="00:00:06.00">Later he brings the monkey to a tree and lets him learn how to pick the coconuts that are ready to eat.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:49.00" dur="00:00:03.00">Step by step, the monkey goes higher and higher.</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.50" dur="00:00:04.00">The trainer uses a rope to control and direct the monkey's work.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:57.00" dur="00:00:07.00">The monkey goes left, right, up and down. When Somporn pulls the rope, the monkey goes faster.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:65.00" dur="00:00:05.00">Monkeys have been helping Thai farmers to pick coconuts for more than a hundred years.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:70.00" dur="00:00:05.50">The monkeys climb trees and twist coconuts with their hands until the fruit falls to the ground.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:75.70" dur="00:00:05.00">Somporn Saewkwo explains the advantages of using monkeys for this job.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:81.50" dur="00:00:08.50">"Nowadays, there are about twelve thousand monkeys in Surat Thani that are working to pick coconuts, helping humans."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:90.50" dur="00:00:03.00">"If we climb up those trees, we can fall and die."</p>

<p begin="00:0:96.50" dur="00:00:03.50">The coconut is an important fruit for farmers here.</p>
<p begin="00:0:100.50" dur="00:00:05.00">Farmers can earn about two dollars for every hundred coconuts that they bring to market.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:106.50" dur="00:00:06.50">People buy the fruit on Thai beaches, and it's also used in the country's popular coconut curry. </p>
    <p begin="00:00:117.00" dur="00:00:05.00">A huge number of coconuts - about 2 million - are produced each month in Thailand.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:123.00" dur="00:00:04.50">And many farmers say they couldn't pick the fruit without help from their monkeys.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:129.00" dur="00:00:06.30">Pak Dee's 3-year-old monkey assists with his work. The monkey picks fruit from Pak's own trees.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:137.00" dur="00:00:04.50">Pak also lends the monkey to other farmers to earn extra money.</p>  
    <p begin="00:00:142.50" dur="00:00:04.00">The animal is so valuable that Pak never leaves it home alone.</p> 
    <p begin="00:00:147.50" dur="00:00:03.00">The monkey could run away or somebody could take it.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:153.50" dur="00:00:03.00">Pak Dee describes the system he uses.</p>
   
    <p begin="00:00:158" dur="00:00:03.00">"I tie the monkey to a coconut tree near the house."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:161.50" dur="00:00:03.00">"I give him rice to eat, sometimes with curry."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:164.50" dur="00:00:05.00">"The monkey can live to be thirteen years old, so he has ten more years that he can work."</p>

    <p begin="00:00:170.00" dur="00:00:06.00">"I don't need any more monkeys than I have now. I just want to carry on with this monkey for his lifetime."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:176.50" dur="00:00:07.00">Farmers say that because the monkeys are so important to them, most are well cared for and don't have a hard life.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:184.00" dur="00:00:04.00">But some people make the animals work too hard, and treat them badly.</p>

    <p begin="00:00:189.50" dur="00:00:05.00">"In the past, everyone was training monkeys in a different way - and some people were hurting the monkeys."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:195.50" dur="00:00:08.50">Trainer Somporn Saewkwo created a different, more gentle method of teaching monkeys, which is now used by others at the monkey training college.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:204.50" dur="00:00:07.50">Because a lot of Thailand's forests have disappeared, more and more monkeys now need man's help to be able to live.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:213.00" dur="00:00:08.50">"All the monkeys that come to stay with us have a better living than in the jungle. One side does not have an advantage over the other."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:222.00" dur="00:00:06.00">As long as Thailand continues to produce coconuts, these farmers will probably continue to use monkeys.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:229.00" dur="00:00:08.00">You see, the monkey and the coconut will be together always. As long as you have the coconut, you will also have the monkey.</p>
