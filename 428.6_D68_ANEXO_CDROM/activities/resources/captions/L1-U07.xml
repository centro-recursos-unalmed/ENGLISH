    <p begin="00:00:04.00" dur="00:00:06.72">Outside a quiet town in Mexico called Sabinas, there's been an amazing discovery...</p>
    <p begin="00:00:11.00" dur="00:00:03.50">...the remains of a very large dinosaur.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:15.00" dur="00:00:9.40">"This is a very important thing, the dinosaur is around 50 feet long, 15 feet high, it might weigh between 3 and 4 tons."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:25.00" dur="00:00:07.50">Jose Gonzalez says that the discovery tells us that the land here, 75 million years ago, was a jungle.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:33.40" dur="00:00:7.10">Today it is a desert. How did the climate change? Scientists are seeking an answer to this mystery.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:41.10" dur="00:00:06.50">In Sabinas, the discovery of the huge dinosaur has created a lot of interest, especially among local children.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:48.50" dur="00:00:5.00">Some of them were looking for ancient tools used by hunters. Instead, they found dinosaur bones.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:55.00" dur="00:00:07.50">"I was with my dad. He was telling me a dinosaur had been found. We went over there and I found a piece of leg bone."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:63.50" dur="00:00:10.00">"When I come out here, I bring the things I need to dig. When I find something that looks like a fossil, I take it to someone so they can tell me if it's a fossil or not."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:74.40" dur="00:00:06.90">News of the dinosaur find has spread quickly. Dinosaur bones have now been found at 13 places.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:83.00" dur="00:00:10.50">And the news has extended to the rest of the world. International paleontologists have come here to examine the giant animal  known as Sabinasaurio.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:94.00" dur="00:00:08.03">Juan Pablo Garcia, a local engineer, first found part of the ancient fossil when he was examining land for construction.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:102.50" dur="00:00:08.40">He says he was very lucky to find the pieces. He found a circular rock and some other bones, but he didn't know what they were.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:111.00" dur="00:00:09.70">Garcia had found pieces of the animal's back bone, a leg bone, and other smaller bones. Now, people are searching for the rest.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:122.10" dur="00:00:07.00">Scientists estimate this could be the most complete dinosaur skeleton ever found in Latin America.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:131.00" dur="00:00:11.20">"These right here are part of the ribs, these are the vertebras, ok? We're talking about this is the neck, the cervical vertebras."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:142.40" dur="00:00:11.00">"Right here you have the body of the animal, the back of the animal, we have around 52-53 vertebras total and right here starts the tail of the animal."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:154.50" dur="00:00:010.00">This isn't the first time fossils have been found here. But the appearance of these fossils means that Sabinas has become an important place for dinosaur hunters.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:165.00" dur="00:00:11.50">The mayor of Sabinas says that the fossils should be kept in a museum. In his opinion, people from all over Mexico - and abroad - should be able to study the area.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:177.40" dur="00:00:09.10">The town's residents feel good that the discovery happened in their town. The group of local people working on the find has grown to more than sixty members.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:191.00" dur="00:00:04.00">The mayor says that the discovery has been great for the town.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:197.30" dur="00:00:04.40">Local people say the dinosaur discovery has changed their city.</p>
   <p begin="00:00:203.50" dur="00:00:06.20">They hope that, in the future, more and more dinosaur lovers will visit their region of Mexico.</p>
