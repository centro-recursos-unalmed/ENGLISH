<p begin="00:00:00.70" dur="00:00:03.30">One of the world’s biggest killers is malaria. </p>
<p begin="00:00:04.50" dur="00:00:02.50">These insects carry the disease. </p>
<p begin="00:00:07.60" dur="00:00:06.90">With all the special and complex products for sale today, the best mosquito repellent comes from a flower.</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.80" dur="00:00:05.80">Here on Kenya’s Lake Nakuru we are looking for the world’s most dangerous animal. </p>
<p begin="00:00:22.00" dur="00:00:02.20">It is not the lion or the leopard.</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.20" dur="00:00:03.00">The most dangerous animal is much smaller. </p>
<p begin="00:00:29.40" dur="00:00:01.30">This is it --  </p>
<p begin="00:00:31.50" dur="00:00:06.50">the tiny but very deadly anopheles mosquito, responsible for spreading Malaria. </p>
<p begin="00:00:38.60" dur="00:00:04.00">All of these insects on this man’s arm are OK because they are from  </p>
<p begin="00:00:42.60" dur="00:00:05.20">the International Centre for Insect Physiology and Ecology outside Nairobi, Kenya. </p>
<p begin="00:00:48.90" dur="00:00:03.50">Here research into malaria is happening now. </p>
<p begin="00:00:53.20" dur="00:00:08.60">"Malaria is still the most important parasitic disease in the wild and according to W.H.O estimates (World Health Organization) 1983,</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.90" dur="00:00:05.40">forty percent of the wild population would suffer a case of Malaria in one year."</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.30" dur="00:00:04.20">"That accounts to about three hundred to four hundred million cases." </p>
<p begin="00:01:12.00" dur="00:00:04.90">"In Africa we lose between one to two million children in one year."</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.40" dur="00:00:06.80">The most important insecticide in the control of mosquitoes is not a synthetic chemical but a natural one </p>
<p begin="00:01:24.20" dur="00:00:02.40">produced by the flower pyrethrum.</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.60" dur="00:00:04.80">The plant is a type of chrysanthemum which grows today all over the world. </p>
<p begin="00:01:33.60" dur="00:00:04.60">Seventy percent of the world’s production comes from here in Kenya. </p>
<p begin="00:01:39.20" dur="00:00:06.30">This is ideal pyrethrum country, because the plant grows best at a high altitude in a dry climate. </p>
<p begin="00:01:46.80" dur="00:00:02.30">The flowers are picked and sun-dried.</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.20" dur="00:00:04.40">The pyrethrum insecticide has a fast knockdown effect on mosquitoes.</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.40" dur="00:00:03.00">It kills them almost instantaneously.</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.40" dur="00:00:06.20">The benefits of pyrethrum over a synthetic insecticide are that it’s an environmentally friendly insecticide </p>
<p begin="00:02:05.70" dur="00:00:04.00">and that insects have no time to build up any resistance to it. </p>
<p begin="00:02:11.40" dur="00:00:04.00">This is a small farm in the Molo district of Kenya’s Rift Valley.</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.90" dur="00:00:01.90">Pyrethrum grows here.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.20" dur="00:00:05.90">This farmer is able to harvest four hundred kilograms of dried flowers from this area a year.</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.20" dur="00:00:03.60">He makes eight hundred dollars of urgently needed cash.</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.50" dur="00:00:03.20">The flowers go to large processing plants.</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.50" dur="00:00:03.40">The pyrethrum extract makes many insecticides. </p>
<p begin="00:02:44.00" dur="00:00:02.80">Its importance is growing around the world.</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.80" dur="00:00:09.75">"Pyrethrum is one of the most important plants in the world because it’s used to kill insects that carry diseases which harm man."</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.60" dur="00:00:01.80">"It fights his enemies."</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.90" dur="00:00:06.00">Most people never know that their insect repellent is made from a flower growing in Africa.</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.20" dur="00:00:03.40">Pyrethrum is one of the plants that is changing the world.</p>
