<p begin="00:00:01.00" dur="00:00:03.90">We usually think Inuit people don’t wear clothes to look good. </p>
<p begin="00:00:05.00" dur="00:00:02.00">It is more important to be warm.</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.70" dur="00:00:04.40">In the Canadian province of Nunavut, in the capital city of Iqaluit, </p>
<p begin="00:00:12.20" dur="00:00:02.20">we can see that this is not true. </p>
<p begin="00:00:14.70" dur="00:00:02.60">It’s high fashion in the high Arctic... </p>
<p begin="00:00:17.90" dur="00:00:01.40">Beautiful jackets...</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.70" dur="00:00:01.00">coats...</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.80" dur="00:00:01.10">sweaters...</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.00" dur="00:00:01.00">dresses...</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.30" dur="00:00:01.00">coats...</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.90" dur="00:00:02.90">"So this is the seals I work with...</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.80" dur="00:00:05.00">beautiful."</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.00" dur="00:00:03.90">From her home in Iqaluit, Aaju Peter designs clothes.</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.00" dur="00:00:02.80">A lot of people like her clothes.</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.80" dur="00:00:03.40">"So when I take this I can turn it into anything."</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.30" dur="00:00:02.20">Anything from a coat to a skirt.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.00" dur="00:00:05.80">"This one was taken from a southern made vest that my sister had given to me."</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.90" dur="00:00:04.30">"This is just so beautiful this is the signature of the North." </p>
<p begin="00:01:01.60" dur="00:00:07.30">The Inuit still use seal skins but they also use modern materials like wool, cotton and synthetic materials.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.95" dur="00:00:03.10">However, they still use traditional designs. </p>
<p begin="00:01:15.20" dur="00:00:02.50">One of the most important is the Amouti:</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.80" dur="00:00:03.00">a jacket with a pouch for carrying a baby.</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.00" dur="00:00:02.30">Women slip the baby over their head.</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.70" dur="00:00:06.50">"There it is inside the pouch and you’re free like a bird, you can do whatever." </p>
<p begin="00:01:31.00" dur="00:00:06.90">"I think since the Inuit are the ones who designed this outfit, Inuit should be the ones showing</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.00" dur="00:00:04.80">the rest of the world how these Amouti's are made and how they are worn."</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.80" dur="00:00:06.40">Because they are worried about the killing of baby seals, the U.S. and Europe banned the sale of seal fur.</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.20" dur="00:00:04.80">"We weren’t doing that of course, and to this day we don’t do that, I mean we use every part of the seal."</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.00" dur="00:00:06.50">"We eat the meat, we use the seal fat, but we need to use the skin to make money</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.50" dur="00:00:07.30">and it’s not affecting the population, the seals are reproducing fine."</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.50" dur="00:00:03.20">But the Inuit say that the seals are not in danger.</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.80" dur="00:00:01.50">There are lots of them.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.30" dur="00:00:01.80">They want to lift the ban.</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.00" dur="00:00:05.10">Inuit clothes have changed but they still use ideas from the past.</p>
