<p begin="00:00:09.00" dur="00:00:04.40">Thai boxing, or muay thai, is Thailand’s oldest martial art. </p>
<p begin="00:00:14.00" dur="00:00:03.00">It looks like Western boxing, but it’s very different.</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.10" dur="00:00:05.40">In Thai boxing, you can use every part of your body: your hands, head, feet, knees</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.00" dur="00:00:01.50">—even elbows are okay.</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.05" dur="00:00:02.40">The sport has a long history.</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.45" dur="00:00:06.00">Two thousand years ago, warriors trained in Thai boxing to protect their country from invaders.</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.30" dur="00:00:02.40">Now it’s one of Thailand’s most popular sports</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.20" dur="00:00:02.00">—everyone loves it.</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.00" dur="00:00:05.20">It’s part of many festivals. You can see it on television around the country every day.</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.00" dur="00:00:06.00">Many boxers in Thailand started boxing at the Lanna Muay Thai Training Camp in Chiang Mai.</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.30" dur="00:00:03.50">Right now, the camp is home for a 12-year-old boy named Manat.</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.20" dur="00:00:02.40">He and 15 other boys are here to become fighters.</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.00" dur="00:00:06.45">Most of the boys are young and they come from very poor families. The camp pays for their training.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.00" dur="00:00:02.30">While they are here, they only box. </p>
<p begin="00:01:10.40" dur="00:00:04.30">The boys train for seven hours a day, seven days of the week.</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.30" dur="00:00:01.40">They train hard. </p>
<p begin="00:01:17.30" dur="00:00:02.10">They wish to become the next great champion. </p>
<p begin="00:01:20.00" dur="00:00:05.00">For Manat and the others, success here can give them better lives and a higher status in Thai society.</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.95" dur="00:00:03.40">Canadian coach Andy Thomson started the camp.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.00" dur="00:00:04.40">"Thai boxing offers the boys a chance at status...</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.12" dur="00:00:05.00">improved status in their community, the opportunity to earn some money,</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.00" dur="00:00:05.30">and most of them will have a dream of being champion one day in Lumphini Stadium in Bangkok."</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.30" dur="00:00:02.40">"It’s an opportunity to open up their world."</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.30" dur="00:00:04.40">For Manat and the other boys, this is their chance to see more than their home village.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.15" dur="00:00:03.00">It’s a chance to make their family and friends proud. </p>
<p begin="00:02:00.30" dur="00:00:02.80">Manat is getting ready for his second fight which is tomorrow. </p>
<p begin="00:02:04.20" dur="00:00:04.00">Thai boxers have to be strong, but they not only train their bodies.</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.30" dur="00:00:02.00">They prepare their minds and the way they think about the fight. </p>
<p begin="00:02:11.30" dur="00:00:04.00">Modern muay thai is about learning to think and fight like a warrior.</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.30" dur="00:00:03.00">And it’s about achieving personal goals.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.00" dur="00:00:05.50">"If I move on to bigger fights, one day I’ll be a champion—a champion of Chiang Mai."</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.00" dur="00:00:04.50">"I’ll feel very proud and good. And I’ll send the money I win to my parents."</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.20" dur="00:00:02.40">Manat’s big night finally arrives.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.20" dur="00:00:03.10">The fight is in a small town outside of Chiang Mai. </p>
<p begin="00:02:41.00" dur="00:00:06.00">Manat goes into the ring for the ‘Rama Muay,' an ancient ceremony which focuses a fighter’s strength and power.</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.10" dur="00:00:02.40">It helps him to get ready for the fight.</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.15" dur="00:00:03.20">After the ceremony, the fight begins.</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.00" dur="00:00:07.00">"The judges are looking for good, clean shot technique—both offensive and defensive."</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.00" dur="00:00:07.00">"They are looking for the boxer who is in control of the fight."</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.20" dur="00:00:06.00">Manat fights hard, but for him, tonight is not the night.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.00" dur="00:00:01.40">He doesn’t win. </p>
<p begin="00:03:22.40" dur="00:00:04.00">Unfortunately, the boy Manat fought was taller, heavier, and more experienced than him. </p>
<p begin="00:03:27.00" dur="00:00:04.30">But even with these disadvantages, Manat did very well. </p>
<p begin="00:03:32.00" dur="00:00:04.30">He may have lost the fight, but his coaches now definitely believe that he can be a winner. </p>
<p begin="00:03:37.00" dur="00:00:07.00">"Manat’s fight was very good. He fought really well. Good attitude...a good heart...very good heart."</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.00" dur="00:00:06.00">"Even though he’s not happy, he’ll be all right tomorrow. He’ll be back fighting again—no problem."</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.20" dur="00:00:07.10">Manat did not win tonight, but this was only one step in the long process of making a Thai boxing champion!</p>
