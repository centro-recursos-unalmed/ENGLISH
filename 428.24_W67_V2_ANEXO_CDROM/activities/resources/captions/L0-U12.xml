<p begin="00:00:02.80" dur="00:00:06.20">Every year’s migration of North America’s monarch butterflies is one of the great spectacles of nature.</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.70" dur="00:00:06.50">Each year, up to 300 million monarchs travel more than 2,000 miles from northern America and Canada</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.20" dur="00:00:04.00">to a remote forest two hundred miles west of Mexico City. </p>
<p begin="00:00:21.10" dur="00:00:02.80">But they are as fragile as they are beautiful. </p>
<p begin="00:00:24.30" dur="00:00:03.30">Sudden changes in their environment can mean disaster. </p>
<p begin="00:00:28.90" dur="00:00:08.00">A January 2002 rainstorm followed with freezing temperatures killed as many as 250 million butterflies,</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.30" dur="00:00:05.20">almost 80 percent of the population in the El Rosario butterfly sanctuary--</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.60" dur="00:00:02.50">just one of six sanctuaries in the area. </p>
<p begin="00:00:45.90" dur="00:00:04.50">Their bodies covered the forest floor, giving off an unusual odor. </p>
<p begin="00:00:52.30" dur="00:00:06.50">Mike Quinn is a Texas biologist with Monarch Watch--an organization based out of the University of Kansas.</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.80" dur="00:00:06.70">He thinks logging, which happens more and more in these reserves, may have contributed to the death of the butterflies. </p>
<p begin="00:01:07.70" dur="00:00:08.50">"Logging is right up to the edge of the colony and logging opens up the forest and lets in the cold air</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.20" dur="00:00:09.40">and freezes penetrate into the forest whereas an intact forest acts as both an umbrella </p>
<p begin="00:01:25.60" dur="00:00:06.50">and as a blanket and that will severely protect the monarchs." </p>
<p begin="00:01:32.10" dur="00:00:07.50">In the last 20 years, logging, mostly illegal, has destroyed nearly half the forests the monarchs need in this region. </p>
<p begin="00:01:40.40" dur="00:00:05.80">The Mexican government, along with the World Wildlife Fund, has started efforts to preserve what is left.</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.90" dur="00:00:03.40">They offer to pay landowners to not cut trees.</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.60" dur="00:00:05.80">But the money is very limited: 18 dollars for every cubic meter of loggable wood -- </p>
<p begin="00:01:56.50" dur="00:00:03.00">not nearly as much money as they can make logging.</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.20" dur="00:00:06.30">The 2002 storm wasn’t the first to hit the monarch population, nor will it likely be the last.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.00" dur="00:00:05.20">For the moment, millions of the monarch butterflies still migrate each year.</p>
