<p begin="00:00:03.80" dur="00:00:05.50">Most people think bungee jumping —as we know it —started in New Zealand.  </p>
<p begin="00:00:09.30" dur="00:00:06.00">However a type of bungee jumping started in the small Pacific island nation of Vanuatu.</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.40" dur="00:00:04.70">At first, it looks like traditional bungee jumping, but it is very different.</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.40" dur="00:00:03.50">This is the Naghol, which means "land diving."  </p>
<p begin="00:00:35.70" dur="00:00:03.60">The diver tries to touch the soil with his head.</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.40" dur="00:00:03.80">The people of Vanuatu believe this will make their crops grow.</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.60" dur="00:00:03.40">They jump from this 70-foot wooden tower. </p>
<p begin="00:00:50.60" dur="00:00:03.60">High on the tower, one man, Rene, has some advice. </p>
<p begin="00:00:54.90" dur="00:00:08.00">"Whenever you are on the tower ready to jump, if you have second thoughts that means you must not jump."</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.90" dur="00:00:03.50">The first diver greets the crowd like a rock star.  </p>
<p begin="00:01:08.70" dur="00:00:01.80">His dive goes well. </p>
<p begin="00:01:11.10" dur="00:00:03.00">He hits the ground hard, but he’s OK.</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.40" dur="00:00:03.00">His friends run to him and free his ankles. </p>
<p begin="00:01:18.70" dur="00:00:02.30">The second dive is not so good.  </p>
<p begin="00:01:22.20" dur="00:00:06.70">The young boys think the vines are not good, but the older, more experienced divers say they are OK.</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.50" dur="00:00:01.10">They aren’t.</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.80" dur="00:00:04.50">On the way down, one of the vines breaks and the young boy hits the ground.  </p>
<p begin="00:01:39.20" dur="00:00:03.30">Everyone helps. But he’s unconscious. </p>
<p begin="00:01:42.70" dur="00:00:02.70">Jumping is sometimes dangerous. </p>
<p begin="00:01:45.45" dur="00:00:04.70">Sometimes people are seriously injured. But usually they are OK.</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.50" dur="00:00:02.25">At last, the boy is better.</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.80" dur="00:00:02.50">He walks away with his friends and brothers.</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.50" dur="00:00:02.00">One of the older men jumps next. </p>
<p begin="00:01:57.70" dur="00:00:01.80">He is standing on the tower.</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.60" dur="00:00:01.50">Eventually he jumps.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.10" dur="00:00:01.70">It’s a very good dive. </p>
<p begin="00:02:04.35" dur="00:00:05.00">Westerners aren’t allowed to jump, but we can tie a small camera to a diver’s leg.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.30" dur="00:00:02.20">We think this is the first time. </p>
<p begin="00:02:20.50" dur="00:00:01.80">The crowd loves it.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.70" dur="00:00:02.20">"Good job. Yeah, very good, very good."</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.00" dur="00:00:02.50">"Aw, great! You did very good. Are you all OK?"</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.50" dur="00:00:04.00">The young man with the camera tells about his jumps in the local language, Raga.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.80" dur="00:00:07.90">“The first dive was great. The second dive I broke a vine.  But as long as I’m not hurt, everything is going well." </p>
<p begin="00:02:42.70" dur="00:00:01.40">"I’m a lucky man."</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.10" dur="00:00:04.40">The last jump is by one of the most experienced divers in Pentecost.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.00" dur="00:00:02.80">He jumps from the tower and everyone is happy.</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.80" dur="00:00:02.60">When it’s over, the children climb the tower. </p>
<p begin="00:03:05.70" dur="00:00:03.50">One day, they might jump.</p>
