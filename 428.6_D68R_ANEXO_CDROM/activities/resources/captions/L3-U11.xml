    <p begin="00:00:01.80" dur="00:00:02.80">Urban art is all about innovation...</p>
    <p begin="00:00:04.70" dur="00:00:03.00">From using buckets on a busy street...</p>
    <p begin="00:00:08.90" dur="00:00:03.00">To filling an art gallery with local graffiti...</p>
    <p begin="00:00:12.60" dur="00:00:06.00">To mixing jazz with spoken word - inviting us to listen with new ears...</p>
    <p begin="00:00:20.60" dur="00:00:02.00">To look with new eyes.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:22.70" dur="00:00:07.00">Wander down this train tunnel in Washington DC,  and you'll discover the bold colors of urban graffiti artists.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:30.10" dur="00:00:04.50">It is Washington's Wall of Fame, and Nick Posada's work is here.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:35.00" dur="00:00:05.10">But unfortunately the art he's created has been covered by other people's graffiti.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:42.10" dur="00:00:07.00">"This is what happens when nobody respects any type of work that someone spent their paint and their time on."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:52.00" dur="00:00:03.00">"This is what the Wall of Fame in DC has come to."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:55.50" dur="00:00:07.00">Although the Wall of Fame is open to everyone, Posada cautions there are rules to be followed in the world of graffiti -</p>
    <p begin="00:00:63.00" dur="00:00:02.80">rules that not everyone appreciates.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:66.00" dur="00:00:06.50">He says that real graffiti artists understand how to use color, and how to make their work distinctive.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:73.20" dur="00:00:02.50">"So you would use colors that contrast one another."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:76.60" dur="00:00:04.40">"Ah, my piece is still there. I did this in, like, '99."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:82.00" dur="00:00:04.00">Nick's work is also highlighted here at the Govinda Gallery in Georgetown.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:87.60" dur="00:00:07.00">"Graffiti art has certainly brought to public art a whole new dimension."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:95.50" dur="00:00:10.00">According to Chris Murray, graffiti art is special because it's fast, uninhibited, and always inventive.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:106.50" dur="00:00:05.50">Murray is convinced that graffiti is just one more step in the evolution of pop art.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:112.70" dur="00:00:05.40">The works have sold well - to young people, and to collectors of pop art.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:118.50" dur="00:00:05.50">In the gallery, people can appreciate the art in a traditional setting - and they like it.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:124.30" dur="00:00:01.90">It's good for the artists, too.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:126.30" dur="00:00:05.60">"It was a real reversal for them because they're used to being vilified and now they're being enjoyed and that's a good thing."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:134.50" dur="00:00:04.00">People are beginning to appreciate the talents of Jafar Barron, too.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:139.00" dur="00:00:05.00">The 28-year-old trumpeter grew up in this neighborhood north of Philadelphia.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:144.70" dur="00:00:04.80">Both his parents are jazz musicians. But Jafar chose to mix more traditional,</p>
    <p begin="00:00:149.55" dur="00:00:05.50">classical forms of jazz with the rap and hip-hop music of his own generation.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:155.05" dur="00:00:03.70">His first CD is an innovative mix of both worlds.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:159.40" dur="00:00:06.50">"I like to think that the whole of creation is all about music, to me, you know what I'm saying?"</p>
    <p begin="00:00:166.40" dur="00:00:03.50">"I believe that the Most High is a musician."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:170.20" dur="00:00:09.00">"I guess it came from my exposure to hip-hop, and the poetry that comes from that, and from some friends of mine."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:180.70" dur="00:00:03.50">Jafar now plays in clubs in the city where he grew up.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:185.40" dur="00:00:03.70">He also now has a deal with a major recording company.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:190.60" dur="00:00:03.00">The stories of how these two artists developed -</p>
    <p begin="00:00:194.00" dur="00:00:02.20">one musical, one visual -</p>
    <p begin="00:00:196.40" dur="00:00:03.30">are not surprising to art history professor Don Kimes.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:200.50" dur="00:00:05.50">"It's about sort of taking what it is that you come from, what you emerge from,</p>
    <p begin="00:00:206.05" dur="00:00:08.00">what's authentic for you, and pushing it to the edge of its envelope, to the edge of its boundaries,</p>
    <p begin="00:00:214.10" dur="00:00:02.50">its limits, and taking one more step."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:216.75" dur="00:00:06.50">Kimes says artists need to build on their own cultural background - as anything else would be false.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:223.75" dur="00:00:04.50">It is said that art is fundamentally about exploration, and discovery.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:228.35" dur="00:00:06.50">Urban artists - whether musicians or painters - can take us to places we've never been before...</p>
    <p begin="00:00:235.00" dur="00:00:03.20">Even if it's as close as a nearby city street.</p>
