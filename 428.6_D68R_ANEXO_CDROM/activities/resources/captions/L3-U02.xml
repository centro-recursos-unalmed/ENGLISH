    <p begin="00:00:02.20" dur="00:00:01.90">"Hi Cassandra, I'm Mike and this is Rick."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:04.20" dur="00:00:06.80">In a London special effects studio, a brave model waits to have her face preserved as a life-like mask...</p>
    <p begin="00:00:11.10" dur="00:00:02.50">"This is a silicone material."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:14.00" dur="00:00:07.00">Silicone is an often rubber-like material that includes silicon and other chemical elements.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:21.00" dur="00:00:01.45">"I'm hoping this is going to do it."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:26.20" dur="00:00:3.15">First...a cap is placed over Cassandra's hair...</p>
    <p begin="00:00:29.45" dur="00:00:07.30">Next...a thin layer of Vaseline is brushed over her eyebrows and lashes to prevent them from sticking to the mask.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:37.80" dur="00:00:03.80">Then a crucial step in the process...the gooey stuff.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:43.20" dur="00:00:07.00">Artists paint her face in quick drying silicone, starting with the eyes, nose, and mouth.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:51.30" dur="00:00:06.50">She has to sit motionless as they devote about an hour to brushing the icy cold silicone onto her face.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:62.00" dur="00:00:03.40">It takes about 3 or 4 minutes for the silicone to dry.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:68.10" dur="00:00:05.00">Then the model's face is wrapped in bandages...rather like a living mummy.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:74.30" dur="00:00:01.40">"Nice and solid."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:76.50" dur="00:00:07.80">The hardened material comes off...followed by the newly created mold, which conforms to the shape of the model's face.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:88.00" dur="00:00:02.00">"Who said modeling was easy."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:94.00" dur="00:00:05.50">At a workshop, the artists create a series of positive and negative masks.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:102.40" dur="00:00:03.00">A master mold is then prepared.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:106.00" dur="00:00:05.50">The artists mix a soft silicone with a combination of chemicals to alter the mask's color,</p>
    <p begin="00:00:112.00" dur="00:00:05.00">creating a natural, uniform shade that's similar to human skin.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:119.30" dur="00:00:03.30">The mixture is then injected into the master mold.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:127.50" dur="00:00:02.70">When it's dry, a face is created.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:131.00" dur="00:00:03.50">A touch of make-up helps bring the skin to life.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:135.80" dur="00:00:04.20">Eyebrows and lashes are carefully added.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:140.00" dur="00:00:03.00">It can take up to 3 hours to do one eyebrow.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:143.70" dur="00:00:05.00">The completed mask has all the fundamental aspects of real human skin...</p>
    <p begin="00:00:150.00" dur="00:00:4.30">It has more than just the look...it has the feel...</p>
	<p begin="00:00:158.00" dur="00:00:4.50">a record of one person's face, preserved in a moment in time.</p>
