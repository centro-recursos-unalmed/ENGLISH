    <p begin="00:00:1.20" dur="00:00:05.00">The holy city of Mecca is located in the western mountains of Saudi Arabia,</p>
    <p begin="00:00:6.20" dur="00:00:04.30">in an area of approximately 250 square kilometers.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:10.50" dur="00:00:01.30">Since long before Islam,</p>
    <p begin="00:00:12.30" dur="00:00:05.50">it has been considered a sacred place where no one could hunt, cut trees, or fight.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:17.80" dur="00:00:07.00">At the heart of the city is a great mosque called Al-Masjid Al Haram, and at its center, is the Kaaba.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:25.00" dur="00:00:02.20">Muslims don't worship the Kaaba.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:27.30" dur="00:00:04.00">They worship what it represents: the one God.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:32.00" dur="00:00:2.70">Hajj takes place in and around Mecca.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:34.70" dur="00:00:09.00">The Hajj comprises a series of rituals that take place between the 8th and 13th days of the last month of the Islamic calendar.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:43.70" dur="00:00:05.30">Circling the Kaaba is the first thing pilgrims do when they get to Mecca, and also the last.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:50.50" dur="00:00:03.50">For Muslims who have prayed in this direction every day for years,</p>
    <p begin="00:00:54.50" dur="00:00:05.20">seeing the Kaaba for the first time is almost overwhelming.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:62.90" dur="00:00:07.70">Now to the Valley of Mina where the Prophet Muhammad stopped and rested on his Hajj nearly 14 centuries ago.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:71.30" dur="00:00:06.10">This is a town whose population grows to two million people in one night.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:80.40" dur="00:00:05.50">At sunrise, the camped pilgrims prepare excitedly for the greatest day of the Hajj.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:87.30" dur="00:00:03.40">Two million people depart for the Plain of Arafat.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:95.60" dur="00:00:04.50">Some 50,000 vehicles accumulate, filling the roads.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:103.20" dur="00:00:02.40">Arafat is eight miles east of Mina.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:106.00" dur="00:00:07.00">It's the place Muslims believe Adam and Eve found each other after they were forced to leave the paradise of Eden.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:113.00" dur="00:00:06.00">The ritual at Arafat is seen by many as a practice for the day of judgment.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:135.00" dur="00:00:04.50">A strange quiet descends in the afternoon, as people turn inward.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:140.00" dur="00:00:03.50">It's called the Standing at Arafat.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:146.50" dur="00:00:05.20">Only when the sun has set can pilgrims leave Arafat.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:153.00" dur="00:00:06.00">Nearly two million people stand ready to move as soon as the sun begins to set.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:161.80" dur="00:00:03.00">The pilgrims move back toward the white tents of Mina,</p>
    <p begin="00:00:165.00" dur="00:00:04.00">where tomorrow they will join in a symbolic struggle with the devil.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:170.00" dur="00:00:07.00">Here, Muslims believe, God commanded Abraham to sacrifice his son but the devil challenged him not to.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:177.00" dur="00:00:7.00">According to one tale, Abraham attacked the devil with stones three separate times, chasing him away.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:184.00" dur="00:00:4.00">Three stone pillars mark the spots where Abraham stood his ground.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:189.00" dur="00:00:6.50">At a place called Muzdalifah, on the way to the pillars, pilgrims pick up small stones to stone Satan themselves.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:196.50" dur="00:00:3.00">The ritual is called the Jamarat.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:200.00" dur="00:00:6.00">With all other rituals complete, pilgrims return to Mecca for a grand final visit.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:206.00" dur="00:00:6.00">They have all earned a special title â€” Hajji for the men, Hajja for the women.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:212.00" dur="00:00:06.00">Many pilgrims arrive in Mecca alone, but they find themselves accompanied by a million strangers.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:218.00" dur="00:00:7.00">Finally after their brief visit, they depart for home riding a spiritual wave of rebirth.</p>
