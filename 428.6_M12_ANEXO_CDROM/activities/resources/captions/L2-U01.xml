    <p begin="00:00:2.00" dur="00:00:05.40">Throughout much of the Mediterranean, olives are an important aspect of everyday life.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:8.00" dur="00:00:06.00">Walk through any Greek market, and you'll find evidence of how important they really are.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:14.50" dur="00:00:07.70">Here, on the island of Naxos, you'll see them in different sizes and in different colors:  green, black, brown  ...</p>
    <p begin="00:00:22.20" dur="00:00:07.00">"I must admit, I was around olive trees most of my life, and it wasn't until several years back that I found out the green olive and the black olive came from the same tree."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:30.80" dur="00:00:06.00">Like this tourist, a lot of people assume that black and green olives come from different trees.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:38.00" dur="00:00:04.00">In fact, most people probably wouldn't recognize an olive tree.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:42.50" dur="00:00:11.00">This time of year, on the hills of Naxos, the olive trees have flowers on them. Without the fruit, though, the tree isn't easy to identify.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:55.00" dur="00:00:09.00">"In this area, between Monitsia and the other village of Moni, which is up in the hills, there are some of the very old olive trees."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:65.00" dur="00:00:3.70">To make green olives, you need to collect them when they are still young.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:69.00" dur="00:00:09.00">There are small ones and giant ones and people decide which ones they prefer. Well, I like all of them. I think I would never say no to any olive."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:78.50" dur="00:00:02.50">Not everyone has the same liking for them.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:81.50" dur="00:00:02.00">"I don't like them. I hate them."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:83.50" dur="00:00:06.30">"Yesterday, I ordered this pizza which had olives on it and I just couldn't take it."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:89.90" dur="00:00:01.70">"It tastes old, it tastes ugly."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:92.30" dur="00:00:02.00">It's true that olives are old.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:95.30" dur="00:00:03.40">Some trees have been alive for thousands of years.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:100.60" dur="00:00:06.50">In fact, olives have been an important part of life here since the early days of Greek civilization.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:108.00" dur="00:00:06.80">In Greek tradition, Eirene, the goddess of peace, is shown carrying an olive branch.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:115.00" dur="00:00:08.80">Even today, olives are associated with peace. If people want to end a war, they are said to "offer an olive branch."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:124.50" dur="00:00:06.00">"From the olive tree, you can actually make  ...  you can use everything. There is nothing you throw away."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:131.00" dur="00:00:06.70">Katharina Bolesch owns a remarkable shop in Naxos where everything is made from olives.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:138.00" dur="00:00:05.50">"You eat the olives, you make oil from it. You can make a kind of tea from the leaves."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:144.00" dur="00:00:03.50">Olive oil accounts for much of Greece's olive production.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:148.00" dur="00:00:09.20">To produce the best liquid, olives are collected and processed once they have become black. The sooner they are pressed, the better the oil.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:158.00" dur="00:00:08.50">Used for cooking, for light, and occasionally as medicine, the oil is believed to give good health and long life to those who use it.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:166.80" dur="00:00:05.20">"They're very valuable for vitamins and their oils are very healthy."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:173.00" dur="00:00:06.00">And the olive trees themselves also help to give the land a feeling of peace.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:180.00" dur="00:00:15.00">"You can have a look around and hear around and understand that all these trees are not aggressive. Their color is a little soft ... all their shape is quite mild."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:198.00" dur="00:00:8.00">"Something that lasts long, give fruits, I think it's a good feeling of what peace means."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:211.50" dur="00:00:03.50"></p>
    <p begin="00:00:224.50" dur="00:00:06.50"></p>
