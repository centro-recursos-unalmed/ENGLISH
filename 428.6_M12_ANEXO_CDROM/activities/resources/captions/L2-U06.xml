    <p begin="00:00:04.30" dur="00:00:2.52">Many people like to go diving when they are on vacation.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:9.20" dur="00:00:3.00">This family is getting ready to dive off the coast of Florida.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:15.30" dur="00:00:2.80">But this is no ordinary dive.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:21.00" dur="00:00:10.20">It may be difficult to comprehend, but there are some people who will pay a lot of money for the opportunity to dive...with sharks.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:35.50" dur="00:00:8.10">Shark tourism is big business in some places and that's raising questions about how close people should get to them.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:45.30" dur="00:00:5.20">"I actually had a chance to lay down on the bottom and the sharks were right in front of me."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:50.50" dur="00:00:6.00">"And I could see their mouths and their eyes and they actually brushed up against me, and it was just really cool."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:57.20" dur="00:00:6.70">Several times a week, diving instructor Jeff Torode takes customers to swim and even play with these harmless nurse sharks.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:64.40" dur="00:00:03.20">But he no longer feeds the sharks as he once did.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:67.80" dur="00:00:10.00">In January 2002, Florida became the first U.S. state to ban the feeding of marine wildlife. That followed a summer of shark attacks which caused a lot of negative publicity.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:78.20" dur="00:00:10.00">The horror of shark attacks makes many people react against them. Some tourists, though, believe they should be able to get close to sharks, including dangerous varieties.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:88.20" dur="00:00:09.10">Divers in the waters of the Florida Keys, for example, often interact with bull, reef, and lemon sharks -- all of which have occasionally attacked people.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:97.30" dur="00:00:05.10">But despite such attacks, it would be inaccurate to say that sharks kill a lot of people.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:102.70" dur="00:00:07.50">In fact, dogs bite more people than sharks do -- and you have a greater chance of getting killed by lightning, bees, or snakes, than by a shark.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:110.30" dur="00:00:5.50">In one recent year, there were just sixty shark attacks against humans, and just three deaths worldwide.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:116.10" dur="00:00:5.00">Still, some people think that it's foolish to feed sharks and bring them close to busy beaches.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:121.50" dur="00:00:02.60">Bob Dimond has been a diver for 30 years.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:126.25" dur="00:00:6.00">He's still diving today -- although he's worried that sharks may be losing their fear of humans.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:134.40" dur="00:00:07.30">"Feeding sharks. The reason - or the purpose - that people feed sharks is to attract them to human beings. That's why they do it."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:142.10" dur="00:00:11.42">"You may not be a shark's prey, but when sharks learn to associate humans with food, they approach you, investigating to see if you have food."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:154.00" dur="00:00:04.00">For Dimond, that's reason enough for banning the feeding of sharks.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:159.40" dur="00:00:02.50">Bob has created the Marine Safety Group.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:163.00" dur="00:00:03.00">Their goal is to ban all shark feeding.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:166.00" dur="00:00:06.50">"If you feed a wild animal you are greatly increasing the chance that that animal will attack humans." </p>
	<p begin="00:00:172.80" dur="00:00:05.00">"That is why it is banned -- in every national park in the United States and Canada."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:178.00" dur="00:00:05.10">Shark feeding has never been directly associated with an attack on a human.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:184.50" dur="00:00:3.50">When a shark does strike it is usually "hit and run."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:188.80" dur="00:00:03.50">It bites and then quickly releases the person and disappears.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:193.20" dur="00:00:07.40">Researchers hypothesize that these sharks may have confused a human with a seal or another animal that they would normally kill.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:201.00" dur="00:00:08.00">For divers such as this 14 year old girl, the opportunity to go diving with sharks is a chance to understand them better.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:209.00" dur="00:00:05.20">Meeting them up close, she says, has made them a little less terrifying.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:214.30" dur="00:00:5.15">"I thought they'd be more scary, but they're not. They were a lot more calmer than I thought they would be."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:220.40" dur="00:00:4.40">"I thought it was pretty cool -- it was really cool. A once-in-a-lifetime experience."</p>
