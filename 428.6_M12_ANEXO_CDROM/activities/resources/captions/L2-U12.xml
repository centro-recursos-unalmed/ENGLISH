    <p begin="00:00:3.00" dur="00:00:07.90">These Girl Scouts from Virginia are on an outing -- but this is no ordinary camping trip. These girls are going caving.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:11.20" dur="00:00:04.20">Jessica Fagan is 17 and has been caving since she was a little girl.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:15.80" dur="00:00:04.00">Her father Joey is an experienced caver and the leader of this trip.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:19.80" dur="00:00:03.80">It was Jessica's love for the sport that led to today's adventure.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:24.00" dur="00:00:5.30">She says the challenge of getting through a difficult cave together creates a special bond.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:29.70" dur="00:00:5.50">"To do something challenging and talk about our lives.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:35.70" dur="00:00:3.50">It's very special I guess how much you bond with people.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:39.50" dur="00:00:4.00">There are girls that I've caved with years and years ago that I still keep in touch with."</p>
	<p begin="00:00:44.60" dur="00:00:5.20">Somewhere in these hills in the heart of Virginia lies the entrance to their destination.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:49.90" dur="00:00:02.50">But it's not easy to enter.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:52.50" dur="00:00:5.10">Using ropes to rappel into the cave is the only real option for going underground.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:58.30" dur="00:00:07.60">Inside, it's very dark, cold, and damp. Lights and warm clothes are both necessities for the cavers.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:66.20" dur="00:00:4.20">After only a few feet they're at a very tight spot called "the chimney."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:70.80" dur="00:00:01.90">It's a drop of nine meters.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:73.00" dur="00:00:02.50">"You can use this as a hand hold, so you can lower yourself."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:76.00" dur="00:00:07.60">Sometimes the only technique you can use in narrow sections of the cave is to carefully slide and squeeze, and slowly ease your way through.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:83.70" dur="00:00:8.20">It's a lesson in confidence -- a lesson that Jessica learned early on when she had to go on her hands and knees over a ledge.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:91.90" dur="00:00:05.30">Although the potential fall was only just over a meter, it was still a frightening experience.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:97.20" dur="00:00:05.60">But, she says, in the cave, everyone encourages each other, and no one gets too scared.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:103.00" dur="00:00:04.00">Jessica explains that the main requirement is confidence, not strength.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:107.20" dur="00:00:7.20">"A lot of the caving challenges are not about how tall or how strong or how big you are, but about how confident you are.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:114.50" dur="00:00:6.10">You need to be optimistic and be like, I can do it, I can crawl through this,</p>
    <p begin="00:00:120.70" dur="00:00:04.90">I can climb up that, and even though you had this thing in the back of your mind saying that you couldn't and you did.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:125.70" dur="00:00:04.30">Then you learn something about yourself and you grow as a person."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:135.40" dur="00:00:06.20">After descending more than 60 meters below the surface, they arrive at a special part of the cave.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:143.00" dur="00:00:05.20">An underground room over 300 meters long and over 20 meters high.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:148.30" dur="00:00:03.40">"This is actually one of the largest rooms in the state of Virginia."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:153.20" dur="00:00:08.20">It's a room as large as three football fields, created out of the surrounding rock by drops of water over millions of years.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:167.50" dur="00:00:3.50">"It's taken millions and millions of years to form the caves ...</p>
	<p begin="00:00:171.20" dur="00:00:7.00">and sometimes when people go caving I don't think they realize how special that is, and how important it is to conserve them,</p>
    <p begin="00:00:179.00" dur="00:00:05.00">and how important it is to not take things off or to write their names."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:185.00" dur="00:00:06.40">Just by listening, the group can tell they're getting closer to something else very special.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:194.50" dur="00:00:07.20">A huge 18-meter waterfall -- a thrilling and exhilarating sight at the end of their long journey.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:205.00" dur="00:00:15.00">"There's so much more to us and to this world than humans. Nature is bigger than we are, and it will be here, the caves will be here, even if we aren't."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:230.50" dur="00:00:03.50"></p>
    <p begin="00:00:230.50" dur="00:00:06.50"></p>
