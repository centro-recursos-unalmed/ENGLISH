    <p begin="00:00:02.00" dur="00:00:01.60">This girl is Quechuan.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:03.80" dur="00:00:05.10">One of the native people of the Andes believed to be direct descendants of the Inca people.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:09.30" dur="00:00:04.50">Clues to where she came from may  lie with one of her ancient ancestors.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:14.50" dur="00:00:06.90">This body of a young Inca girl was discovered in 1995 by  archeologist Johan Reinhard.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:22.00" dur="00:00:3.60">She was found on an Andean mountain called Ampato.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:25.80" dur="00:00:3.80">Some parts of her body were mummified, preserved in ice.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:29.90" dur="00:00:4.10">They named the girl after Johan, calling her  "Juanita."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:35.20" dur="00:00:04.50">"When we climbed the peak and we found the mummy, then we knew we were really onto something."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:39.70" dur="00:00:6.90">"That they had not just worshipped it from afar, but they had actually climbed to the summit and made these sacrificial offerings."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:47.10" dur="00:00:08.55">Reinhard and his team walked high into the Andes, the mountain range that runs from the north of Peru to the south, dividing the country in half.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:55.80" dur="00:00:04.40">For the Inca people, these were more than just challenging places to climb...</p>
    <p begin="00:00:60.30" dur="00:00:02.30">The mountains were thought to be gods.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:63.00" dur="00:00:8.60">According to Reinhard, the Inca believed that if they made offerings - in this case young girls - the mountains would treat them well.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:72.30" dur="00:00:04.50">If they didn't respect the mountain gods, the people would have great problems.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:78.30" dur="00:00:06.70">After their success in finding the Inca girl, Reinhard's team went back to conduct a second exploration.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:85.70" dur="00:00:02.70">Their findings this time were equally important.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:89.90" dur="00:00:8.90">On the ground lay six stone circles - patterns of rock used by the Inca long ago to show the location of burial sites.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:100.00" dur="00:00:05.90">After carefully digging beneath one of these circles, the body of another child was found.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:106.80" dur="00:00:02.90">And not too far away,  yet another body.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:111.50" dur="00:00:05.50">The discovery of more bodies implies that many people were sacrificed here.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:117.50" dur="00:00:08.40">"This site looks like they had multi human sacrifices, not just multi burials and so that makes it particularly unique."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:127.10" dur="00:00:04.60">It wasn't easy to free the bodies or the objects that they found in the ground.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:132.60" dur="00:00:6.50">The ground was frozen, and the team had to use their fingers to slowly take out the ancient pots.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:141.30" dur="00:00:09.70">While the archeologists conducted their investigation, the body of the original ice maiden, Juanita, was carefully analyzed in the Peruvian town of Arequipa.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:151.30" dur="00:00:02.00">She was found covered in cloth.</p>
	 <p begin="00:00:153.60" dur="00:00:04.80">Scientists had to separate the outer layers of clothing which had become attached over the years.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:159.20" dur="00:00:05.30">A few months after she was discovered, Juanita was sent to Johns Hopkins University in the U.S.,</p>
    <p begin="00:00:164.70" dur="00:00:03.50">where a team of scientists looked for clues about her death.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:168.30" dur="00:00:06.90">They used modern technology to deduce that a powerful blow to the side of her head had broken her skull.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:175.90" dur="00:00:05.15">According to their theory, it was this injury that ended the young girl's life.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:181.35" dur="00:00:09.50">Like all mummified bodies found in the Andes, Juanita enables us to understand more about the ancient Inca people who once lived in these mountains.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:191.00" dur="00:00:06.00">Juanita could be evidence of a connection with the people, like this little Quechuan girl, who live here now.</p>
