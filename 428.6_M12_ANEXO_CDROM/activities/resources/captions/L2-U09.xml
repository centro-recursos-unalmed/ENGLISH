    <p begin="00:00:08.30" dur="00:00:10.10">It is modern, yet has its origin in the past -- the Nubian wedding ritual, celebrated by the entire village ... for seven days and nights.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:19.20" dur="00:00:7.00">The air is perfumed by incense and filled with the sound of drums and joyful Nubian songs.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:28.00" dur="00:00:4.50">Two years ago Sheriff's family told him it was time to get married.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:33.20" dur="00:00:04.40">So he visited every home in the village, looking for the right girl.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:38.10" dur="00:00:5.50">Then he saw Abeer, and he ran home to tell his mother he had found his bride.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:44.30" dur="00:00:05.20">The two young people were not reunited until just before their Muslim wedding.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:51.30" dur="00:00:6.50">"The first time I saw her, when the Sheik came to sign the book, I looked at her picture to make sure it was her."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:63.30" dur="00:00:5.00">After the legal papers are signed, seven days of celebration begin.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:69.20" dur="00:00:4.60">Each day, early in the morning, the party begins to fill the nearby streets.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:76.00" dur="00:00:03.50">The bride is painted all over with henna.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:79.70" dur="00:00:8.00">One day before the wedding ceremony, the groom's bed is taken outside to be bathed in sweet-smelling incense.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:87.80" dur="00:00:09.10">The groom himself is also perfumed. The scents, which will last for weeks, are supposed to get his blood moving and give him strength.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:97.20" dur="00:00:11.40">Who are the Nubians and where did they come from? They traditionally lived along the banks of the Nile River, in what is now southern Egypt and northern Sudan.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:108.65" dur="00:00:2.50">But in the 1960's that changed.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:111.30" dur="00:00:08.50">In Egypt, the Nubian population was removed by the Egyptian government and their ancient lands were flooded when the Aswan dam was built.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:120.80" dur="00:00:02.70">Mohammed Nour came here at the age of 12. </p>
    <p begin="00:00:123.70" dur="00:00:05.20">His family left their simple home made of mud and moved into a government house.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:129.00" dur="00:00:08.00">"Even though there, in the old village, there was no electricity or means of transportation like we have here now, still life there was better."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:137.30" dur="00:00:6.20">"There we used to keep our Nubian traditions and Nubian language. Nubian language could be endangered here today."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:146.60" dur="00:00:07.60">On the final night of the wedding, the village is served a celebratory meal of meat and rice in front of the groom's house.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:154.90" dur="00:00:8.90">Then, gripping a sword and whip in his hands, the groom leaves his parent's home and leads his neighbors through the streets, singing religious songs.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:165.00" dur="00:00:04.90">Some time after midnight, the groom picks up the bride and they arrive at the party.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:170.40" dur="00:00:05.40">They spend all night dancing and singing, from early evening until noon the next day.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:182.70" dur="00:00:08.10">The word "Nubia" derives from an ancient word for gold, and refers to the gold mines for which the area was once famous.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:194.00" dur="00:00:5.50">That gold still shines today as a friend wraps the bride in decorative jewelry.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:203.40" dur="00:00:4.80">It's now past three o'clock in the morning, but the party has just begun.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:212.10" dur="00:00:06.50">After the exchange of rings, the groom's mother kisses her son and his new bride as they begin their life together...</p>
    <p begin="00:00:219.00" dur="00:00:06.90"> ... carrying on their ancient customs -- Egyptian by nationality, but Nubian by tradition.</p>
