    <p begin="00:00:01.50" dur="00:00:06.90">The Abuku Sokoke Forest is home to more than a third of Kenya's eight hundred and seventy species of butterfly.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:9.90" dur="00:00:09.00">The demand for unusual butterfly species for public and private collections has long been a threat to natural environments such as this Kenyan forest.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:20.00" dur="00:00:07.50">In the past, butterfly collectors caught thousands of insects from the wild, sending live animals to Europe and the U.S.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:28.60" dur="00:00:04.00">It's sad to say that most probably died before they arrived.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:33.40" dur="00:00:6.50">Several years ago local farmers decided to use their capabilities for a different project: rearing caterpillars.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:41.00" dur="00:00:6.50">The caterpillars are sent around the world as pupae and arrive just in time to become adult African butterflies.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:48.10" dur="00:00:3.50">These butterflies have a survival rate of nearly one hundred percent.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:52.30" dur="00:00:6.40">"Abuku Sokoke Forest is important because it is the largest remaining coastal forest in East Africa."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:60.20" dur="00:00:5.20">The main threats to the forests, he says, are cutting down the trees to make places to live.</p>
	<p begin="00:00:67.00" dur="00:00:5.00">Now people are better educated, and they can see the benefits of keeping the forests.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:73.50" dur="00:00:6.00">They are getting income from butterfly farming, bee keeping, and from plants that can be used for medicine.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:83.60" dur="00:00:03.90">"So at least they have seen the benefits of having the forest stay."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:87.80" dur="00:00:4.20">This is the project's headquarters, right in the heart of the forest.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:92.70" dur="00:00:03.80">Farmers from all over the region come here to breed the butterflies.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:97.40" dur="00:00:08.50">The price of each species varies a lot according to international supply and demand, so these farmers have to know which butterflies buyers want to buy.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:107.20" dur="00:00:06.30">Much of the credit for the project's success must go to this man: Washington Iemba.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:114.50" dur="00:00:08.50">"The Butterfly Farm started in 1993 and the objective then was to develop local support for the conservation of Abuku Sokoke Forest."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:124.70" dur="00:00:08.10">Until recently, he says, many of his fellow community members objected to the way the forest was managed because they couldn't derive income from it.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:135.50" dur="00:00:06.00">But he says that farming butterflies has now become attractive, as it constitutes a new source of income.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:142.00" dur="00:00:06.50">"Now, most of the farmers even know the botanical names like any university student."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:149.00" dur="00:00:4.50">The process involves community members first catching a small number of butterflies.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:153.80" dur="00:00:02.70">These are then carefully released into a closed area.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:157.00" dur="00:00:03.40">The females lay their eggs and caterpillars finally emerge.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:160.60" dur="00:00:07.50">After they pupate, or enter their cocoons, the caterpillars are brought to the project center where the farmers receive money for their work.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:169.20" dur="00:00:07.00">"What do you have for us today? These ones are very good, in fact you can see they are shaking, shaking, showing that they are still very fresh."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:176.40" dur="00:00:04.40">"But if you remember to have Monideas, because Monideas at the moment is the one that has a lot of market space."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:182.20" dur="00:00:7.70">Each farmer retains a small number of pupae so that the entire process can be repeated without having to collect new insects from the wild.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:192.00" dur="00:00:3.50">"In a year we sell pupae worth almost sixty thousand US dollars ..."</p>
	 <p begin="00:00:196.00" dur="00:00:08.40">"Of these, sixty percent goes to the local communities mostly for food, and school uniforms, school fees, hospital bills."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:205.10" dur="00:00:07.00">"The most attractive aspect has been that, unlike other programs used in forest areas, this has quick returns."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:212.50" dur="00:00:07.80">"Within one month of farming butterflies one is able to generate income and use it, and therefore adding more value to the program itself."</p>
    <p begin="00:00:221.00" dur="00:00:06.80">In the beginning, one hundred workers cooperated to start the project. Now there are more than one thousand.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:229.60" dur="00:00:06.30">The success of the Butterfly Project has resulted in similar projects being established in parks all over Kenya.</p>
